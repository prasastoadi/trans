<title>Al Gore: Averting the climate crisis</title> 
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: With the same humor and humanity he exuded in "An Inconvenient Truth," Al Gore spells out 15 ways that individuals can address climate change immediately, from buying a hybrid to inventing a new, hotter brand name for global warming.</description> 
Thank you so much, Chris. And it's truly a great honor to have the opportunity to come to this stage twice; I'm extremely grateful. 
I have been blown away by this conference, and I want to thank all of you for the many nice comments about what I had to say the other night. 
And I say that sincerely, partly because (Mock sob) I need that.  Put yourselves in my position.  I flew on Air Force Two for eight years.  Now I have to take off my shoes or boots to get on an airplane! 
  I'll tell you one quick story to illustrate what that's been like for me. 
It's a true story -- every bit of this is true. 
Soon after Tipper and I left the -- (Mock sob) White House --  we were driving from our home in Nashville to a little farm we have 50 miles east of Nashville. 
Driving ourselves. 
I know it sounds like a little thing to you, but --  I looked in the rear-view mirror and all of a sudden it just hit me. 
There was no motorcade back there. 
You've heard of phantom limb pain?  This was a rented Ford Taurus.  It was dinnertime, and we started looking for a place to eat. 
We were on I-40. We got to Exit 238, Lebanon, Tennessee. 
We got off the exit, we found a Shoney's restaurant. 
Low-cost family restaurant chain, for those of you who don't know it. 
We went in and sat down at the booth, and the waitress came over, made a big commotion over Tipper.  She took our order, and then went to the couple in the booth next to us, and she lowered her voice so much, I had to really strain to hear what she was saying. 
And she said "Yes, that's former Vice President Al Gore and his wife, Tipper." 
And the man said, "He's come down a long way, hasn't he?"  There's been kind of a series of epiphanies.  The very next day, continuing the totally true story, I got on a G-V to fly to Africa to make a speech in Nigeria, in the city of Lagos, on the topic of energy. 
And I began the speech by telling them the story of what had just happened the day before in Nashville. 
And I told it pretty much the same way I've just shared it with you: Tipper and I were driving ourselves, Shoney's, low-cost family restaurant chain, what the man said -- they laughed. 
I gave my speech, then went back out to the airport to fly back home. 
I fell asleep on the plane until, during the middle of the night, we landed on the Azores Islands for refueling. 
I woke up, they opened the door, I went out to get some fresh air, and I looked, and there was a man running across the runway. 
And he was waving a piece of paper, and he was yelling, "Call Washington! Call Washington!" 
And I thought to myself, in the middle of the night, in the middle of the Atlantic, what in the world could be wrong in Washington? 
Then I remembered it could be a bunch of things. 
 But what it turned out to be, was that my staff was extremely upset because one of the wire services in Nigeria had already written a story about my speech, and it had already been printed in cities all across the United States of America. 
It was printed in Monterey, I checked.  And the story began, "Former Vice President Al Gore announced in Nigeria yesterday," quote: 'My wife Tipper and I have opened a low-cost family restaurant'" --  "'named Shoney's, and we are running it ourselves.'"  Before I could get back to U.S. soil, David Letterman and Jay Leno had already started in on -- 
one of them had me in a big white chef's hat, Tipper was saying, "One more burger with fries!" 
 Three days later, I got a nice, long, handwritten letter from my friend and partner and colleague Bill Clinton, saying, "Congratulations on the new restaurant, Al!" 
 We like to celebrate each other's successes in life. 
I was going to talk about information ecology. 
But I was thinking that, since I plan to make a lifelong habit of coming back to TED, that maybe I could talk about that another time.  Chris Anderson: It's a deal! 
 Al Gore: I want to focus on what many of you have said What can you do about the climate crisis? I want to start with a couple of -- I'm going to show some new images, and I'm going to recapitulate just four or five. Now, the slide show. 
I add new images, because I learn more about it every time I give it. 
It's like beach-combing, you know? 
Every time the tide comes in and out, you find some more shells. 
Just in the last two days, we got the new temperature records in January. 
This is just for the United States of America. 
Historical average for Januarys is 31 degrees; last month was 39.5 degrees. 
Now, I know that you wanted some more bad news about the environment -- I'm kidding. But these are the recapitulation slides, and then I'm going to go into new material about what you can do. 
But I wanted to elaborate on a couple of these. 
First of all, this is where we're projected to go with the U.S. contribution to global warming, under business as usual. Efficiency in end-use electricity and end-use of all energy Efficiency and conservation -- it's not a cost; it's a profit. The sign is wrong. 
It's not negative; it's positive. These are investments that pay for themselves. 
But they are also very effective in deflecting our path. 
Cars and trucks -- I talked about that in the slideshow, but I want you to put it in perspective. 
It's an easy, visible target of concern -- and it should be -- but there is more global warming pollution that comes from buildings than from cars and trucks. 
Cars and trucks are very significant, and we have the lowest standards in the world. 
And so we should address that. But it's part of the puzzle. 
Other transportation efficiency is as important as cars and trucks. 
Renewables at the current levels of technological efficiency can make this much difference. And with what Vinod, and John Doerr and others, many of you here -- there are a lot of people directly involved in this -- this wedge is going to grow much more rapidly than the current projection shows it. 
Carbon Capture and Sequestration -- that's what CCS stands for -- is likely to become the killer app that will enable us to continue to use fossil fuels in a way that is safe. 
Not quite there yet. 
OK. Now, what can you do? Reduce emissions in your home. 
Most of these expenditures are also profitable. 
Insulation, better design. Buy green electricity where you can. 
I mentioned automobiles -- buy a hybrid. Use light rail. 
Figure out some of the other options that are much better. It's important. 
Be a green consumer. You have choices with everything you buy, between things that have a harsh effect, or a much less harsh effect on the global climate crisis. 
Consider this: Make a decision to live a carbon-neutral life. 
Those of you who are good at branding, I'd love to get your advice and help on how to say this in a way that connects with the most people. 
It is easier than you think. It really is. 
A lot of us in here have made that decision, and it is really pretty easy. 
It means reduce your carbon dioxide emissions with the full range of choices that you make, and then purchase or acquire offsets for the remainder that you have not completely reduced. 
And what it means is elaborated at climatecrisis.net. 
There is a carbon calculator. Participant Productions convened -- with my active involvement -- the leading software writers in the world, on this arcane science of carbon calculation, to construct a consumer-friendly carbon calculator. 
You can very precisely calculate what your CO2 emissions are, and then you will be given options to reduce. 
And by the time the movie comes out in May, this will be updated to 2.0, and we will have click-through purchases of offsets. 
Next, consider making your business carbon-neutral. Again, some of us have done that, and it's not as hard as you think. Integrate climate solutions into all of your innovations, whether you are from the technology, or entertainment, or design and architecture community. 
Invest sustainably. Majora mentioned this. 
Listen, if you have invested money with managers who you compensate on the basis of their annual performance, don't ever again complain about quarterly report CEO management. 
Over time, people do what you pay them to do. And if they judge how much they're going to get paid on your capital that they've invested, based on the short-term returns, you're going to get short-term decisions. 
A lot more to be said about that. 
Become a catalyst of change. Teach others, learn about it, talk about it. 
The movie is a movie version of the slideshow I gave two nights ago, except it's a lot more entertaining. And it comes out in May. 
Many of you here have the opportunity to ensure that a lot of people see it. 
Consider sending somebody to Nashville. Pick well. 
And I am personally going to train people to give this slideshow -- re-purposed, with some of the personal stories obviously replaced with a generic approach, and it's not just the slides, it's what they mean. And it's how they link together. 
And so I'm going to be conducting a course this summer for a group of people that are nominated by different folks to come and then give it en masse, in communities all across the country, and we're going to update the slideshow for all of them every single week, to keep it right on the cutting edge. 
Working with Larry Lessig, it will be, somewhere in that process, posted with tools and limited-use copyrights, so that young people can remix it and do it in their own way. 
 Where did anybody get the idea that you ought to stay arm's length from politics? 
It doesn't mean that if you're a Republican, that I'm trying to convince you to be a Democrat. 
We need Republicans as well. This used to be a bipartisan issue, and I know that in this group it really is. Become politically active. 
Make our democracy work the way it's supposed to work. 
Support the idea of capping carbon dioxide emissions -- global warming pollution -- and trading it. 
Here's why: as long as the United States is out of the world system, it's not a closed system. 
Once it becomes a closed system, with U.S. participation, then everybody who's on a board of directors -- how many people here serve on the board of directors of a corporation? 
Once it's a closed system, you will have legal liability if you do not urge your CEO to get the maximum income from reducing and trading the carbon emissions that can be avoided. The market will work to solve this problem -- if we can accomplish this. 
Help with the mass persuasion campaign that will start this spring. 
We have to change the minds of the American people. 
Because presently, the politicians do not have permission to do what needs to be done. 
And in our modern country, the role of logic and reason no longer includes mediating between wealth and power the way it once did. 
It's now repetition of short, hot-button, 30-second, 28-second television ads. 
We have to buy a lot of those ads. 
Let's re-brand global warming, as many of you have suggested. 
I like "climate crisis" instead of "climate collapse," but again, those of you who are good at branding, I need your help on this. 
Somebody said the test we're facing now, a scientist told me, is whether the combination of an opposable thumb and a neocortex is a viable combination. 
That's really true. I said the other night, and I'll repeat now: this is not a political issue. 
Again, the Republicans here -- this shouldn't be partisan. 
You have more influence than some of us who are Democrats do. 
This is an opportunity. Not just this, but connected to the ideas that are here, to bring more coherence to them. 
We are one. 
Thank you very much, I appreciate it.

<title>Amy Smith: Simple designs to save a life</title> 
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Fumes from indoor cooking fires kill more than 2 million children a year in the developing world. MIT engineer Amy Smith details an exciting but simple solution: a tool for turning farm waste into clean-burning charcoal.</description> 
In terms of invention, I'd like to tell you the tale of one of my favorite projects. 
I think it's one of the most exciting that I'm working on, but I think it's also the simplest. 
It's a project that has the potential to make a huge impact around the world. 
It addresses one of the biggest health issues on the planet, the number one cause of death in children under five. 
Which is ...? Water-borne diseases? Diarrhea? Malnutrition? No. 
It's breathing the smoke from indoor cooking fires -- acute respiratory infections caused by this. Can you believe that? 
I find this shocking and somewhat appalling. 
Can't we make cleaner burning cooking fuels? 
Can't we make better stoves? 
How is it that this can lead to over two million deaths every year? 
I know Bill Joy was talking to you about the wonders of carbon nanotubes, so I'm going to talk to you about the wonders of carbon macro-tubes, which is charcoal. 
So this is a picture of rural Haiti. Haiti is now 98 percent deforested. 
You'll see scenes like this all over the island. 
It leads to all sorts of environmental problems and problems that affect people throughout the nation. 
A couple years ago there was severe flooding that led to thousands of deaths -- that's directly attributable to the fact that there are no trees on the hills to stabilize the soil. 
So the rains come -- they go down the rivers and the flooding happens. 
Now one of the reasons why there are so few trees is this: people need to cook, and they harvest wood and they make charcoal in order to do it. 
It's not that people are ignorant to the environmental damage. 
They know perfectly well, but they have no other choice. 
Fossil fuels are not available, and solar energy doesn't cook the way that they like their food prepared. 
And so this is what they do. 
You'll find families like this who go out into the forest to find a tree, cut it down and make charcoal out of it. 
So not surprisingly, there's a lot of effort that's been done to look at alternative cooking fuels. 
About four years ago, I took a team of students down to Haiti and we worked with Peace Corps volunteers there. 
This is one such volunteer and this is a device that he had built in the village where he worked. 
And the idea was that you could take waste paper; you could compress it and make briquettes that could be used for fuel. 
But this device was very slow. 
So our engineering students went to work on it and with some very simple changes, they were able to triple the throughput of this device. 
So you could imagine they were very excited about it. 
And they took the briquettes back to MIT so that they could test them. 
And one of the things that they found was they didn't burn. 
So it was a little discouraging to the students. 
And in fact, if you look closely, right here you can see it says, "US Peace Corps." 
As it turns out, there actually wasn't any waste paper in this village. 
And while it was a good use of government paperwork for this volunteer to bring it back with him to his village, it was 800 kilometers away. 
And so we thought perhaps there might be a better way to come up with an alternative cooking fuel. 
What we wanted to do is we wanted to make a fuel that used something that was readily available on the local level. 
You see these all over Haiti as well. They're small-scale sugar mills. 
And the waste product from them after you extract the juice from the sugarcane is called "bagasse." 
It has no other use. 
It has no nutritional value, so they don't feed it to the animals. 
It just sits in a pile near the sugar mill until eventually they burn it. 
What we wanted to do was we wanted to find a way to harness this waste resource and turn it into a fuel that would be something that people could easily cook with, something like charcoal. 
So over the next couple of years, students and I worked to develop a process. 
So you start with the bagasse, and then you take a very simple kiln that you can make out of a waste fifty five-gallon oil drum. 
After some time, after setting it on fire, you seal it to restrict the oxygen that goes into the kiln, and then you end up with this carbonized material here. 
However, you can't burn this. 
It's too fine and it burns too quickly to be useful for cooking. 
So we had to try to find a way to form it into useful briquettes. 
And conveniently, one of my students was from Ghana, and he remembered a dish his mom used to make for him called "kokonte," which is a very sticky porridge made out of the cassava root. 
And so what we did was we looked, and we found that cassava is indeed grown in Haiti, under the name of "manioc." 
In fact, it's grown all over the world -- yucca, tapioca, manioc, cassava, it's all the same thing -- a very starchy root vegetable. 
And you can make a very thick, sticky porridge out of it, which you can use to bind together the charcoal briquettes. 
So we did this. We went down to Haiti. 
These are the graduates of the first Ecole de Charbon, or Charcoal Institute. And these --  That's right. So I'm actually an instructor at MIT as well as CIT. 
And these are the briquettes that we made. 
Now I'm going to take you to a different continent. This is India and this is the most commonly used cooking fuel in India. It's cow dung. 
And more than in Haiti, this produces really smoky fires, and this is where you see the health impacts of cooking with cow dung and biomass as a fuel. 
Kids and women are especially affected by it, because they're the ones who are around the cooking fires. 
So we wanted to see if we could introduce this charcoal-making technology there. 
Well, unfortunately, they didn't have sugarcane and they didn't have cassava, but that didn't stop us. 
What we did was we found what were the locally available sources of biomass. 
And there was wheat straw and there was rice straw in this area. 
And what we could use as a binder was actually small amounts of cow manure, which they used ordinarily for their fuel. 
And we did side-by-side tests, and here you can see the charcoal briquettes and here the cow dung. 
And you can see that it's a lot cleaner burning of a cooking fuel. 
And in fact, it heats the water a lot more quickly. 
And so we were very happy, thus far. 
But one of the things that we found was when we did side-by-side comparisons with wood charcoal, it didn't burn as long. And the briquettes crumbled a little bit and we lost energy as they fell apart as they were cooking. 
So we wanted to try to find a way to make a stronger briquette so that we could compete with wood charcoal in the markets in Haiti. 
So we went back to MIT, we took out the Instron machine and we figured out what sort of forces you needed in order to compress a briquette to the level that you actually are getting improved performance out of it? 
And at the same time that we had students in the lab looking at this, we also had community partners in Haiti working to develop the process, to improve it and make it more accessible to people in the villages there. 
And after some time, we developed a low-cost press that allows you to produce charcoal, which actually now burns not only -- actually, it burns longer, cleaner than wood charcoal. 
So now we're in a situation where we have a product, which is actually better than what you can buy in Haiti in the marketplace, which is a very wonderful place to be. 
In Haiti alone, about 30 million trees are cut down every year. 
There's a possibility of this being implemented and saving a good portion of those. 
In addition, the revenue generated from that charcoal is 260 million dollars. 
That's an awful lot for a country like Haiti -- with a population of eight million and an average income of less than 400 dollars. 
So this is where we're also moving ahead with our charcoal project. 
And one of the things that I think is also interesting, is I have a friend up at UC Berkeley who's been doing risk analysis. 
And he's looked at the problem of the health impacts of burning wood versus charcoal. 
And he's found that worldwide, you could prevent a million deaths switching from wood to charcoal as a cooking fuel. 
That's remarkable, but up until now, there weren't ways to do it without cutting down trees. 
But now we have a way that's using an agricultural waste material to create a cooking fuel. 
One of the really exciting things, though, is something that came out of the trip that I took to Ghana just last month. 
And I think it's the coolest thing, and it's even lower tech than what you just saw, if you can imagine such a thing. Here it is. 
So what is this? This is corncobs turned into charcoal. 
And the beauty of this is that you don't need to form briquettes -- it comes ready made. This is my $100 laptop, right here. 
And actually, like Nick, I brought samples. 
 So we can pass these around. 
They're fully functional, field-tested, ready to roll out. 
And I think one of the things which is also remarkable about this technology, is that the technology transfer is so easy. 
Compared to the sugarcane charcoal, where we have to teach people how to form it into briquettes and you have the extra step of cooking the binder, this comes pre-briquetted. 
And this is about the most exciting thing in my life right now, which is perhaps a sad commentary on my life. 
 But once you see it, like you guys in the front row -- All right, yeah, OK. So anyway --  Here it is. And this is, I think, a perfect example of what Robert Wright was talking about in those non-zero-sum things. 
So not only do you have health benefits, you have environmental benefits. 
But this is one of the incredibly rare situations where you also have economic benefits. 
People can make their own cooking fuel from waste products. 
They can generate income from this. 
They can save the money that they were going to spend on charcoal and they can produce excess and sell it in the market to people who aren't making their own. 
It's really rare that you don't have trade-offs between health and economics, or environment and economics. 
So this is a project that I just find extremely exciting and I'm really looking forward to see where it takes us. 
So when we talk about, now, the future we will create, one of the things that I think is necessary is to have a very clear vision of the world that we live in. 
And now, I don't actually mean the world that we live in. 
I mean the world where women spend two to three hours everyday grinding grain for their families to eat. 
I mean the world where advanced building materials means cement roofing tiles that are made by hand, and where, when you work 10 hours a day, you're still only earning 60 dollars in a month. 
I mean the world where women and children spend 40 billion hours a year fetching water. 
That's as if the entire workforce of the state of California worked full time for a year doing nothing but fetching water. 
It's a place where, for example, if this were India, in this room, only three of us would have a car. 
If this were Afghanistan, only one person in this room would know how the use the Internet. 
If this were Zambia -- 300 of you would be farmers, 100 of you would have AIDS or HIV. 
And more than half of you would be living on less than a dollar a day. 
These are the issues that we need to come up with solutions for. 
These are the issues that we need to be training our engineers, our designers, our business people, our entrepreneurs to be facing. 
These are the solutions that we need to find. 
I have a few areas that I believe are especially important that we address. 
One of them is creating technologies to promote micro-finance and micro-enterprise, so that people who are living below the poverty line can find a way to move out -- and that they're not doing it using the same traditional basket making, poultry rearing, etc. 
But there are new technologies and new products that they can make on a small scale. 
The next thing I believe is that we need to create technologies for poor farmers to add value to their own crops. 
And we need to rethink our development strategies, so that we're not promoting educational campaigns to get them to stop being farmers, but rather to stop being poor farmers. 
And we need to think about how we can do that effectively. 
We need to work with the people in these communities and give them the resources and the tools that they need to solve their own problems. That's the best way to do it. 
We shouldn't be doing it from outside. 
So we need to create this future, and we need to start doing it now. 
Thank you. 
 Chris Anderson: Thank you, incredible. Stay here. Tell us -- just while we see if someone has a question -- just tell us about one of the other things that you've worked on. 
Amy Smith: Some of the other things we're working on are ways to do low-cost water quality testing, so that communities can maintain their own water systems, know when they're working, know when they treat them, etc. 
We're also looking at low-cost water-treatment systems. 
One of the really exciting things is looking at solar water disinfection and improving the ability to be able to do that. 
CA: What's the bottleneck preventing this stuff getting from scale? 
Do you need to find entrepreneurs, or venture capitalists, or what do you need to take what you've got and get it to scale? 
AS: I think it's large numbers of people moving it forward. 
It's a difficult thing -- it's a marketplace which is very fragmented and a consumer population with no income. 
So you can't use the same models that you use in the United States for making things move forward. 
And we're a pretty small staff, which is me. 
 So, you know, I do what I can with the students. 
We have 30 students a year go out into the field and try to implement this and move it forward. 
The other thing is you have to do things with a long time frame, as, you know, you can't expect to get something done in a year or two years; you have to be looking five or 10 years ahead. 
But I think with the vision to do that, we can move forward.

<title>David Rockwell: A memorial at Ground Zero</title> 
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: In this emotionally charged conversation with journalist Kurt Andersen, designer David Rockwell discusses the process of building a viewing platform at Ground Zero shortly after 9/11.</description> 
Kurt Andersen: Like many architects, David is a hog for the limelight but is sufficiently reticent -- or at least pretends to be -- that he asked me to question him rather than speaking. 
In fact what we're going to talk about, I think, is in fact a subject that is probably better served by a conversation than an address. 
And I guess we have a bit of news clip to precede. 
Dan Rather: Since the September 11th attack on the World Trade Center, many people have flocked to downtown New York to see and pay respects at what amounts to the 16-acre burial ground. 
Now, as CBS's Jim Axelrod reports, they're putting the finishing touches on a new way for people to visit and view the scene. 
Jim Axelrod: Forget the Empire State Building or the Statue of Liberty. 
There's a new place in New York where the crowds are thickest -- Ground Zero. 
Tourist: I've taken my step-daughter here from Indianapolis. 
This was -- out of all the tourist sites in New York City -- this was her number-one pick. 
JA: Thousands now line up on lower Broadway. 
Tourist: I've been wanting to come down here since this happened. 
JA: Even on the coldest winter days. 
To honor and remember. 
Tourist: It's reality, it's us. It happened here. 
This is ours. 
JA: So many, in fact, that seeing has become a bit of a problem. 
Tourist: I think that people are very frustrated that they're not able to get closer to see what's going on. 
JA: But that is about to change. 
In record time, a team of architects and construction workers designed and built a viewing platform to ease the frustration and bring people closer. 
Man: They'll get an incredible panorama and understand, I think more completely, the sheer totality of the destruction of the place. 
JA: If you think about it, Ground Zero is unlike most any other tourist site in America. 
Unlike the Grand Canyon or the Washington Monument, people come here to see what's no longer there. 
David Rockwell: The first experience people will have here when they see this is not as a construction site but as this incredibly moving burial ground. 
JA: The walls are bare by design, so people can fill them with their own memorials the way they already have along the current perimeter. 
Tourist: From our hearts, it affected us just as much. 
JA: The ramps are made of simple material -- the kind of plywood you see at construction sites -- which is really the whole point. 
In the face of America's worst destruction people are building again. 
Jim Axelrod, CBS News, New York. 
KA: This is not an obvious subject to be in the sensuality segment, but certainly David you are known as -- I know, a phrase you hate -- an entertainment architect. 
Your work is highly sensual, even hedonistic. 
DR: I like that word. 
KA: It's about pleasure -- casinos and hotels and restaurants. 
How did the shock that all of us -- and especially all of us in New York -- felt on the 11th of September transmute into your desire to do this thing? 
DR: Well the truth of the matter is, post-September 11th, I felt myself in the role originally -- first of all as someone who lives in Tribeca and whose neighborhood was devastated, and as someone who works less than a mile from there -- that I was in the role of forcing 100 people who work with me in my firm, to continue to have the same level of enthusiasm 
about creating the places we had been creating. 
In fact we're finishing a book which is called "Pleasure," which is about sensual pleasure in spaces. 
But I've got to tell you -- it became impossible to do that. 
We were really paralyzed. 
And I found myself the Friday after September 11th -- two days afterwards -- literally unable to motivate anyone to do anything. 
We gave the office a few days off. 
And in discussing this with other architects, we had seen people saying in the press that they should rebuild the towers as they were -- they should rebuild them 50 stories taller. 
And I thought it was astonishing to speculate, as if this were a competition, on something that was such a fresh wound. 
And I had a series of discussions -- first with Rick Scofidio and Liz Diller, who collaborated with us on this, and several other people -- and really felt like we had to find relevance in doing something. 
And that as people who create places, the ultimate way to help wasn't to pontificate or to make up scenarios, but to help right now. 
So we tried to come up with a way, as a group, to have a kind of design SWAT team. 
And that was the mission that we came up with. 
KA: Were you conscious of suddenly -- as a designer whose work is all about fulfilling wants -- suddenly fulfilling needs? 
DR: Well what I was aware of was, there was this overwhelming need to act now. 
And we were asked to participate in a few projects before this. 
There was a school, PS 234, that had been evacuated down at Ground Zero. 
They moved to an abandoned school. 
We took about 20 or 30 architects and designers and artists, and over four days -- it was like this urban barn-raising -- to renovate it, and everyone wanted to help. 
It was just extraordinary. 
Tom Otterness contributed, Maira Kalman contributed and it became this cathartic experience for us. 
KA: And that was done, effectively, by October 8 or something? 
DR: Yeah. 
KA: Obviously, what you faced in trying to do something as substantial as this project -- and this is only one of four that you've designed to surround the site -- you must have run up against the incredibly byzantine, entrenched bureaucracy and powers that be in New York real estate and New York politics. 
DR: Well, it's a funny thing. 
We finished PS 234, and had dinner with a small group. 
I was actually asked to be a committee chair on an AIA committee to rebuild. 
And I sat in on several meetings. 
And there were the most circuitous grand plans that had to do with long-term infrastructure and rebuilding the entire city. 
And the fact is that there were immediate wounds and needs that needed to be filled, and there was talk about inclusion and wanting it to be an inclusive process. 
And it wasn't an inclusive group. 
So we said, what is -- KA: It was not an inclusive group? 
DR: It was not an inclusive group. 
It was predominantly a white, rich, corporate group that was not representative of the city. 
KA: Shocking. 
DR: Yeah, surprising. 
So Rick and Liz and Kevin and I came up with the idea. 
The city actually approached us. 
We first approached the city about Pier 94. 
We saw how PS 234 worked. 
The families -- the victims of the families -- were going to this pier that was incredibly dehumanizing. 
KA: On the Hudson River? 
DR: Yeah. And the city actually -- through Tim Zagat initially, and then through Christyne Nicholas, then we got to Giuliani -- said, "You know we don't want to do anything with Pier 94 right now, but we have an observation platform for the families down at Ground Zero that we'd like to be a more dignified experience for the families, 
and a way to protect it from the weather." 
So I went down there with Rick and Liz and Kevin, and I've got to say, it was the most moving experience of my life. 
It was devastating to see the simple plywood platform with a rail around it, where the families of the victims had left notes to them. 
And there was no mediation between us and the experience. 
There was no filter. 
And I remembered on September 11th, on 14th Street, the roof of our building -- we can see the World Trade Towers prominently -- and I saw the first building collapse from a conference room on the eighth floor on a TV that we had set up. 
And then everyone was up on the roof, so I ran up there. 
And it was amazing how much harder it was to believe in real life than it was on TV. 
There was something about the comfort of the filter and how much information was between us and the experience. 
So seeing this in a very simple, dignified way was a very powerful experience. 
So we went back to the city and said we're not particularly interested in the upgrade of this as a VIP platform, but we've spent some time down there. 
At the same time the city had this need. 
They were looking for a solution to deal with 30 or 40 thousand people a day who were going down there, that had nowhere to go. 
And there was no way to deal with the traffic around the site. 
So dealing with it is just an immediate master plan. 
There was a way -- there had to be a way -- to get people to move around the site. 
KA: But then you've got to figure out a way -- we will skip over the insanely tedious process of getting permits and getting everybody on board -- but simply funding this thing. 
It looks like a fairly simple thing, but this was a half a million dollar project? 
DR: Well, we knew that if it wasn't privately funded, it wasn't going to happen. 
And we also, frankly, knew that if it didn't happen by the end of the Giuliani administration, then everyone who we were dealing with at the DOT and the Police Department and all of the -- we were meeting with 20 or 30 people with the city at a time, and it was set up by the Office of Emergency Management. 
This incredible act on their part, because they really wanted this, and they sensed that this needed to happen. 
KA: And there was therefore this ticking clock, because Giuliani was obviously out three months after that. 
DR: Yeah. So the first thing we had to do was find a way to get this -- we had to work with the families of the victims, through the city, to make sure that they knew this was happening. 
Because this didn't want to be a surprise. 
And we also had to be as under the radar screen as we could be in New York, because the key was not raising a lot of objection and sort of working as quietly as possible. 
We came up with the idea of setting up a foundation, mainly because when we found a contractor who would build this, he would not agree to do this, even if we would pay him the money. 
There needed to be a foundation in place. 
So we came up with a foundation, and actually what happened was one major developer in New York -- KA: Who shall remain nameless, I guess? 
DR: Yeah. His initials are JS, and he owns Rockefeller Center, if that helps anyone -- volunteered to help. 
And we met with him. 
The prices from the contractors were between five to 700,000 dollars. 
And Atlantic-Heydt, who's the largest scaffolding contractor in the country, volunteered to do it at cost. 
So this developer said, "You know what, we'll underwrite the entire expense." 
And we said, "That's incredible!" 
And I think this was the 21st, and we knew this had to be built and up by the 28th. 
And we had to start construction the next day. 
We had a meeting that evening with his contractor of choice, and the contractor showed up with the drawings of the platform about half the size that we had drawn it. 
KA: Sort of like the Spinal Tap scene where you get the tiny little Stonehenge, I guess? 
 DR: In fact, it was as if this was going to be window-washing scaffolding. 
There was no sense of the fact that this is next to Saint Paul -- that this is really a place that needs to be kind of dignified, and a place to reflect and remember. 
And I've got to say that we spent a lot of time in putting this together, watching the crowds that gathered at Saint Paul -- which is just to the right -- and moving around the site. 
And I live down there, so we spent a lot of time looking at the need. 
And I think people were amazed at two things -- I think they were amazed at the destruction, but I think there was a sense of disbelief about the heroics of New Yorkers that I found very moving. 
Just the sort of everyday heroics of New Yorkers. 
So we were in this meeting and the contractor literally said, "I'm going to lock the door, because this developer will not agree to have you leave till you've signed off on this." 
And we said, "Well, this is half the size, it doesn't have any of the design features that have been agreed upon by everyone -- everyone in the city. 
We'd have to go back to the beginning to do this." 
And I convinced him that we should leave the room with the agreement to build it as designed. 
The next day I got an email from the developer saying that he was withdrawing all funding. 
So we didn't know what to do, but we decided to cast a very wide net. 
We emailed out letters to as many people as we could -- several people in the audience here -- who were very helpful. 
KA: There was no thought of abandoning ship at that point? 
DR: No. In fact I told the contractor to go ahead. 
He had already ordered materials based on my go-ahead. 
We knew that one way or another this was going to happen. 
And we just felt it had to happen. 
KA: You were funding it yourself and with contributions and this foundation. 
Richard, I think very correctly, made the point at the beginning -- before all the chair designers came out -- about the history of chair designers imposing aesthetic solutions on this kind of universal, banal, common problem of sitting. 
It seems to me with this, that it was the opposite of that. 
This was an unprecedented, singular design problem. 
DR: Well here's the issue: we knew that this was not in the sense of -- we think about the site, and think about the need for a memorial. 
It was important that this not be categorized as a memorial. 
That this was a place for people to reflect, to remember -- a kind of quiet place. 
So it led us to using design solutions that created as few filters between the viewer -- as we said about the families' platform -- and the experience as possible. 
It's all incredibly humble material. 
It's scaffolding and plywood. 
And it allows -- by sort of the procession of the movement, up by Saint Paul's and down the other side -- it gives you about 300 feet to go up 13 feet from the ground to where you get the 360 degree view. 
But the design was driven by a need to be quick, cheap, safe, respectful, flexible. 
One of the other things is this is designed to be moveable. 
Because when we looked at the four platforms around the site, one of which is an upgrade of the families' platform, we knew that these had to be moveable to respond to changing conditions, and the changing definition of what Ground Zero is. 
KA: Your work -- I mean, we've talked about this before -- a lot of your work, I think, is informed by your belief in, or your focus on the temporariness of all things and the evanescence of things, and a kind of "Eat, drink, and be merry, for tomorrow we die," sort of sense of existence. 
This is clearly not a work for the ages. 
You know, a couple of years this thing isn't going to be here. 
Did that require, as an architect, a new way of thinking about what you were doing? 
To think of it as this purely temporary installation? 
DR: No, I don't think so. 
I think this is, obviously, substantially different from anything we'd ever thought about doing before, just by the nature of it. 
Where it overlaps with thoughts about our work in general is, number one -- the notion of collaboration as a sort of way to get things done. 
And Kevin Kennon, Rick Scofidio, Liz Diller and all the people within the city -- Norman Lear, who I spoke to four hours before our deadline for funding, offered to give us a bridge loan to help us get through it. 
So the notion of collaboration -- I think this reinforces how important that is. 
And in terms of the temporary nature of it, our goal was not to create something that would be there longer than it needed to be. 
I think what we were most interested in was promoting a kind of dialogue that we felt may not have been happening enough in this city, about what's really happening there. 
And a day or two before it opened was Giuliani's farewell address, where he proposed the idea of all of Ground Zero being a memorial. 
Which was very controversial, but it resonated with a lot of people. 
And I think regardless of what the position is about how this sacred piece of land is to be used, having it come out of actually seeing it in a real encounter, I think makes it a more powerful dialogue. 
And that's what we were interested in. 
So that, very much, is in the realm of things I've been interested in before. 
KA: It seems to me, among other things, a lovely piece of civic infrastructure. 
It enables that conversation to get serious. 
And six months after the fact -- and only a few months away from the site being cleaned -- we are very quickly, now, getting to the point where those conversations about what should go there are getting serious. 
Do you have -- having been as physically involved in the site as you have been doing this project -- have any ideas about what should or shouldn't be done? 
DR: Well, I think one thing that shouldn't be done is evaluate -- I think right now the discussion is a very closed discussion on the master plan. 
The Protetch Gallery recently had a show on ideas for buildings, which had some sort of inventive ideas of buildings. 
KA: But it had some really terrible ideas. 
DR: And it also felt a little bit like a kind of competition of ideas, where I think the focus of ideas should be on master planning and uses. 
And I think there should be a broader -- which there's starting to be -- the dialogue is really opening up to, what does this site really want to be? 
And I truly believe until the issue of memorial is sorted out, that it's going to be very hard to have an intelligent discussion. 
There's a few discussions right now that I think are very positive, about depressing the West Side Highway and connecting this over, so that there's one uninterrupted piece of land. 
KA: Well, I think that's interesting. 
And it gets to another issue that was probably inappropriate to discuss six months ago, but perhaps isn't now, which is, not many of us love the World Trade Center as a piece of architecture, as what it had done to this city and that huge plaza. 
Is this an opportunity, is the silver lining -- a silver lining, here -- to rebuild some more traditional city grid, or not? 
DR: I think there's a real opportunity to engage in a discussion of why we live in cities. 
And why do we live in places where such dissimilar people collide up against us each day? 
I don't think it has much to do with 50 or 60 or 70 or 80 thousand new office spaces, regardless of what the number is. 
So yeah, I think there is a chance to re-look at how we think about cities. 
And in fact, there's a proposal on the table now for building number seven. 
KA: Which was the building just north of the Towers? 
DR: Right, which the towers fell into. 
And the reason that's been held up is essentially by community outrage that they're not re-opening the street to connect that back to the rest of the city. 
I think a public dialogue -- I think, you know, I'd like to see an international competition, and a call for ideas for uses. 
KA: Whether it's arts, whether it's housing, whether it's what amount of shopping? 
DR: Right. And we're looking for other things. 
This small foundation we put together is looking for other ways to help. 
Including taking a small piece adjacent to the site and inviting 10 architects who currently don't have a voice in New York to do artist housing. 
And find other ways to encourage the discussion to be against sort of monolithic, single solutions, and more about a multiplicity of things. 
KA: Before we end, I know you have a piece of digital video of the experience of being on this platform? 
DR: John Kamen -- who's here, actually -- put together a two and a half minute piece that shows the platform in use. 
So I thought that would be good to end with. 
DR: We're looking from Fulton Street, west. 
One of the tricky issues we had with the Giuliani administration was I had forgotten how anti-graffiti he was. 
And essentially our structure was designed to be written on. 
KA: As you say, it's not a memorial. 
But were you conscious of memorials? The Vietnam Memorial? 
Those kinds of forms? 
DR: We certainly did as much research as we could, and we were conscious of other memorials. 
And also the complexity and length of time they really take to do. 
It's 350 people on the committee for Oklahoma City, which is why we thought of this as a sort of ad-hoc, spontaneous solution that expanded on Union Square and the places that were ad-hoc memorials in the city already. 
The scaffolding you can see built up over the street is de-mountable. 
What's interesting now is the nature of the site has totally changed, so that what you're aware of is not just the destruction of the buildings in Ground Zero, but all of the buildings around it -- and the scars on the building around it, which are enormous. 
This shows Saint Paul's on the left. 
KA: I just want to thank you on behalf of New Yorkers for making this happen and getting this done. 
But the kind of virtually instantaneous nature of its erection, and its being there, almost before you could believe that a response of this magnitude could be accomplished, is part of its extraordinary -- I don't know if beauty is the word -- but presence. 
DR: It was an honor to do. 
And we were thrilled to be able to show it here.

<title>Dean Ornish: The killer American diet that's sweeping the planet</title> 
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Forget the latest disease in the news: Cardiovascular disease kills more people than everything else combined -- and it’s mostly preventable. Dr. Dean Ornish explains how changing our eating habits can save lives.</description> 
With all the legitimate concerns about AIDS and avian flu -- and we'll hear about that from the brilliant Dr. Brilliant later today -- I want to talk about the other pandemic, which is cardiovascular disease, diabetes, hypertension -- all of which are completely preventable for at least 95 percent of people just by changing diet and lifestyle. 
And what's happening is that there's a globalization of illness occurring, that people are starting to eat like us, and live like us, and die like us. And in one generation, for example, Asia's gone from having one of the lowest rates of heart disease and obesity and diabetes to one of the highest. And in Africa, cardiovascular disease equals the HIV and AIDS deaths 
in most countries. 
So there's a critical window of opportunity we have to make an important difference that can affect the lives of literally millions of people, and practice preventive medicine on a global scale. 
Heart and blood vessel diseases still kill more people -- not only in this country, but also worldwide -- than everything else combined, and yet it's completely preventable for almost everybody. 
It's not only preventable; it's actually reversible. And for the last almost 29 years, we've been able to show that by simply changing diet and lifestyle, using these very high-tech, expensive, state-of-the-art measures to prove how powerful these very simple and low-tech and low-cost interventions can be like -- quantitative arteriography, before and after a year, and cardiac PET scans. 
We showed a few months ago -- we published the first study showing you can actually stop or reverse the progression of prostate cancer by making changes in diet and lifestyle, and 70 percent regression in the tumor growth, or inhibition of the tumor growth, compared to only nine percent in the control group. 
And in the MRI and MR spectroscopy here, the prostate tumor activity is shown in red -- you can see it diminishing after a year. 
Now there is an epidemic of obesity: two-thirds of adults and 15 percent of kids. What's really concerning to me is that diabetes has increased 70 percent in the past 10 years, and this may be the first generation in which our kids live a shorter life span than we do. That's pitiful, and it's preventable. 
Now these are not election returns, these are the people -- the number of the people who are obese by state, beginning in '85, '86, '87 -- these are from the CDC website -- '88, '89, '90, '91 -- you get a new category -- '92, '93, '94, '95, '96, '97, '98, '99, 2000, 2001 -- it gets worse. We're kind of devolving.  
Now what can we do about this? Well, you know, the diet that we've found that can reverse heart disease and cancer is an Asian diet. 
But the people in Asia are starting to eat like we are, which is why they're starting to get sick So I've been working with a lot of the big food companies. They can make it fun and sexy and hip and crunchy and convenient to eat healthier foods, like -- I chair the advisory boards to McDonald's, and PepsiCo, and ConAgra, and Safeway, and soon 
Del Monte, and they're finding that it's good business. 
The salads that you see at McDonald's came from the work -- they're going to have an Asian salad. At Pepsi, two-thirds of their revenue growth came from their better foods. 
And so if we can do that, then we can free up resources for buying drugs that you really do need for treating AIDS and HIV and malaria and for preventing avian flu. Thank you.

<title>Frank Gehry: A master architect asks, Now what?</title> 
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: In a wildly entertaining discussion with Richard Saul Wurman, architect Frank Gehry gives TEDsters his take on the power of failure, his recent buildings, and the all-important "Then what?" factor.</description> 
Frank Gehry: I listened to this scientist this morning. 
Dr. Mullis was talking about his experiments, and I realized that I almost became a scientist. 
When I was 14 my parents bought me a chemistry set and I decided to make water. 
 So, I made a hydrogen generator and I made an oxygen generator, and I had the two pipes leading into a beaker and I threw a match in. 
 And the glass -- luckily I turned around -- I had it all in my back and I was about 15 feet away. 
The wall was covered with ... 
I had an explosion. 
Richard Saul Wurman: Really? 
FG: People on the street came and knocked on the door to see if I was okay. 
RSW: ... huh.  I'd like to start this session again. 
The gentleman to my left is the very famous, perhaps overly famous, Frank Gehry. 
  And Frank, you've come to a place in your life, which is astonishing. 
I mean it is astonishing for an artist, for an architect, to become actually an icon and a legend in their own time. 
I mean you have become, whether you can giggle at it because it's a funny ... you know, it's a strange thought, but your building is an icon -- you can draw a little picture of that building, it can be used in ads -- and you've had not rock star status, but celebrity status in doing what you wanted to do for most of your life. 
And I know the road was extremely difficult. 
And it didn't seem, at least, that your sell outs, whatever they were, were very big. 
You kept moving ahead in a life where you're dependent on working for somebody. 
But that's an interesting thing for a creative person. 
A lot of us work for people; we're in the hands of other people. 
And that's one of the great dilemmas -- we're in a creativity session -- it's one of the great dilemmas in creativity: how to do work that's big enough and not sell out. 
And you've achieved that and that makes your win doubly big, triply big. 
It's not quite a question but you can comment on it. 
It's a big issue. 
FG: Well, I've always just ... 
I've never really gone out looking for work. 
I always waited for it to sort of hit me on the head. 
And when I started out, I thought that architecture was a service business and that you had to please the clients and stuff. 
And I realized when I'd come into the meetings with these corrugated metal and chain link stuff, and people would just look at me like I'd just landed from Mars. 
But I couldn't do anything else. 
That was my response to the people in the time. 
And actually, it was responding to clients that I had who didn't have very much money, so they couldn't afford very much. 
I think it was circumstantial. 
Until I got to my house, where the client was my wife. 
We bought this tiny little bungalow in Santa Monica and for like 50 grand I built a house around it. 
And a few people got excited about it. 
I was visiting with an artist, Michael Heizer, out in the desert near Las Vegas somewhere. 
He's building this huge concrete place. 
And it was late in the evening. We'd had a lot to drink. 
We were standing out in the desert all alone and, thinking about my house, he said, "Did it ever occur to you if you built stuff more permanent, somewhere in 2000 years somebody's going to like it?" 
 So, I thought, "Yeah, that's probably a good idea." 
Luckily I started to get some clients that had a little more money, so the stuff was a little more permanent. 
But I just found out the world ain't going to last that long, this guy was telling us the other day. 
So where do we go now? 
Back to -- everything's so temporary. 
I don't see it the way you characterized it. 
For me, every day is a new thing. 
I approach each project with a new insecurity, almost like the first project I ever did, and I get the sweats, I go in and start working, I'm not sure where I'm going -- if I knew where I was going, I wouldn't do it. 
When I can predict or plan it, I don't do it. 
I discard it. 
So I approach it with the same trepidation. 
Obviously, over time I have a lot more confidence that it's going to be OK. 
I do run a kind of a business -- I've got 120 people and you've got to pay them, so there's a lot of responsibility involved -- but the actual work on the project is with, I think, a healthy insecurity. 
And like the playwright said the other day -- I could relate to him: you're not sure. 
When Bilbao was finished and I looked at it, I saw all the mistakes, I saw ... 
They weren't mistakes; I saw everything that I would have changed and I was embarrassed by it. 
I felt an embarrassment -- "How could I have done that? 
How could I have made shapes like that or done stuff like that?" 
It's taken several years to now look at it detached and say -- as you walk around the corner and a piece of it works with the road and the street, and it appears to have a relationship -- that I started to like it. 
RSW: What's the status of the New York project? 
FG: I don't really know. 
Tom Krens came to me with Bilbao and explained it all to me, and I thought he was nuts. 
I didn't think he knew what he was doing, and he pulled it off. 
So, I think he's Icarus and Phoenix all in one guy. 
 He gets up there and then he ... comes back up. 
They're still talking about it. 
September 11 generated some interest in moving it over to Ground Zero, and I'm totally against that. 
I just feel uncomfortable talking about or building anything on Ground Zero I think for a long time. 
RSW: The picture on the screen, is that Disney? 
FG: Yeah. 
RSW: How much further along is it than that, and when will that be finished? 
FG: That will be finished in 2003 -- September, October -- and I'm hoping Kyu, and Herbie, and Yo-Yo and all those guys come play with us at that place. 
Luckily, today most of the people I'm working with are people I really like. 
Richard Koshalek is probably one of the main reasons that Disney Hall came to me. 
He's been a cheerleader for quite a long time. 
There aren't many people around that are really involved with architecture as clients. 
If you think about the world, and even just in this audience, most of us are involved with buildings. 
Nothing that you would call architecture, right? 
And so to find one, a guy like that, you hang on to him. 
He's become the head of Art Center, and there's a building by Craig Ellwood there. 
I knew Craig and respected him. 
They want to add to it and it's hard to add to a building like that -- it's a beautiful, minimalist, black steel building -- and Richard wants to add a library and more student stuff and it's a lot of acreage. 
I convinced him to let me bring in another architect from Portugal: Alvaro Siza. 
RSW: Why did you want that? 
FG: I knew you'd ask that question. 
It was intuitive. 
 Alvaro Siza grew up and lived in Portugal and is probably considered the Portuguese main guy in architecture. 
I visited with him a few years ago and he showed me his early work, and his early work had a resemblance to my early work. 
When I came out of college, I started to try to do things contextually in Southern California, and you got into the logic of Spanish colonial tile roofs and things like that. 
I tried to understand that language as a beginning, as a place to jump off, and there was so much of it being done by spec builders and it was trivialized so much that it wasn't ... 
I just stopped. 
I mean, Charlie Moore did a bunch of it, but it didn't feel good to me. 
Siza, on the other hand, continued in Portugal where the real stuff was and evolved a modern language that relates to that historic language. 
And I always felt that he should come to Southern California and do a building. 
I tried to get him a couple of jobs and they didn't pan out. 
I like the idea of collaboration with people like that because it pushes you. 
I've done it with Claes Oldenburg and with Richard Serra, who doesn't think architecture is art. 
Did you see that thing? 
RSW: No. What did he say? 
FG: He calls architecture "plumbing." 
 FG: Anyway, the Siza thing. 
It's a richer experience. 
It must be like that for Kyu doing things with musicians -- it's similar to that I would imagine -- where you ... huh? 
Audience: Liquid architecture. 
FG: Liquid architecture. 
 Where you ... It's like jazz: you improvise, you work together, you play off each other, you make something, they make something. 
And I think for me, it's a way of trying to understand the city and what might happen in the city. 
RSW: Is it going to be near the current campus? 
Or is it going to be down near ... 
FG: No, it's near the current campus. 
Anyway, he's that kind of patron. 
It's not his money, of course. 
 RSW: What's his schedule on that? 
FG: I don't know. 
What's the schedule, Richard? 
Richard Koshalek: [Unclear] starts from 2004. 
FG: 2004. 
You can come to the opening. I'll invite you. 
No, but the issue of city building in democracy is interesting because it creates chaos, right? 
Everybody doing their thing makes a very chaotic environment, and if you can figure out how to work off each other -- if you can get a bunch of people who respect each other's work and play off each other, you might be able to create models for how to build sections of the city without resorting to the one architect. 
Like the Rockefeller Center model, which is kind of from another era. 
RSW: I found the most remarkable thing. 
My preconception of Bilbao was this wonderful building, you go inside and there'd be extraordinary spaces. 
I'd seen drawings you had presented here at TED. 
The surprise of Bilbao was in its context to the city. 
That was the surprise of going across the river, of going on the highway around it, of walking down the street and finding it. 
That was the real surprise of Bilbao. 
FG: But you know, Richard, most architects when they present their work -- most of the people we know, you get up and you talk about your work, and it's almost like you tell everybody you're a good guy by saying, "Look, I'm worried about the context, I'm worried about the city, I'm worried about my client, I worry about budget, that I'm on time." 
Blah, blah, blah and all that stuff. 
And it's like cleansing yourself so that you can ... 
by saying all that, it means your work is good somehow. 
And I think everybody -- I mean that should be a matter of fact, like gravity. 
You're not going to defy gravity. 
You've got to work with the building department. 
If you don't meet the budgets, you're not going to get much work. 
If it leaks -- Bilbao did not leak. 
I was so proud. 
 The MIT project -- they were interviewing me for MIT and they sent their facilities people to Bilbao. 
I met them in Bilbao. 
They came for three days. 
RSW: This is the computer building? 
FG: Yeah, the computer building. 
They were there three days and it rained every day and they kept walking around -- I noticed they were looking under things and looking for things, and they wanted to know where the buckets were hidden, you know? 
People put buckets out ... 
I was clean. There wasn't a bloody leak in the place, it was just fantastic. 
But you've got to -- yeah, well up until then every building leaked, so this ... 
 RSW: Frank had a sort of ... 
FG: Ask Miriam! 
RW: ... sort of had a fame. His fame was built on that in L.A. for a while. 
 FG: You've all heard the Frank Lloyd Wright story, when the woman called and said, "Mr. Wright, I'm sitting on the couch and the water's pouring in on my head." 
And he said, "Madam, move your chair." 
 So, some years later I was doing a building, a little house on the beach for Norton Simon, and his secretary, who was kind of a hell on wheels type lady, called me and said, "Mr. Simon's sitting at his desk and the water's coming in on his head." 
And I told her the Frank Lloyd Wright story. 
RSW: Didn't get a laugh. 
FG: No. Not now either. 
 But my point is that ... and I call it the "then what?" 
OK, you solved all the problems, you did all the stuff, you made nice, you loved your clients, you loved the city, you're a good guy, you're a good person ... 
and then what? 
What do you bring to it? 
And I think that's what I've always been interested in, is that -- which is a personal kind of expression. 
Bilbao, I think, shows that you can have that kind of personal expression and still touch all the bases that are necessary of fitting into the city. 
That's what reminded me of it. 
And I think that's the issue, you know; it's the "then what" that most clients who hire architects -- most clients aren't hiring architects for that. 
They're hiring them to get it done, get it on budget, be polite, and they're missing out on the real value of an architect. 
RSW: At a certain point a number of years ago, people -- when Michael Graves was a fashion, before teapots ... 
FG: I did a teapot and nobody bought it. 
 RSW: Did it leak? 
FG: No. 
 RSW: ... people wanted a Michael Graves building. 
Is that a curse, that people want a Bilbao building? 
FG: Yeah. 
Since Bilbao opened, which is now four, five years, both Krens and I have been called with at least 100 opportunities -- China, Brazil, other parts of Spain -- to come in and do the Bilbao effect. 
And I've met with some of these people. 
Usually I say no right away, but some of them come with pedigree and they sound well-intentioned and they get you for at least one or two meetings. 
In one case, I flew all the way to Malaga with a team because the thing was signed with seals and various very official seals from the city, and that they wanted me to come and do a building in their port. 
I asked them what kind of building it was. 
"When you get here we'll explain it." Blah, blah, blah. 
So four of us went. 
And they took us -- they put us up in a great hotel and we were looking over the bay, and then they took us in a boat out in the water and showed us all these sights in the harbor. 
Each one was more beautiful than the other. 
And then we were going to have lunch with the mayor and we were going to have dinner with the most important people in Malaga. 
Just before going to lunch with the mayor, we went to the harbor commissioner. 
It was a table as long as this carpet and the harbor commissioner was here, and I was here, and my guys. 
We sat down, and we had a drink of water and everybody was quiet. 
And the guy looked at me and said, "Now what can I do for you, Mr. Gehry?" 
 RSW: Oh, my God. 
FG: So, I got up. 
I said to my team, "Let's get out of here." 
We stood up, we walked out. 
They followed -- the guy that dragged us there followed us and he said, "You mean you're not going to have lunch with the mayor?" 
I said, "Nope." 
"You're not going to have dinner at all?" 
They just brought us there to hustle this group, you know, to create a project. 
And we get a lot of that. 
Luckily, I'm old enough that I can complain I can't travel. 
 I don't have my own plane yet. 
RSW: Well, I'm going to wind this up and wind up the meeting because it's been very long. 
But let me just say a couple words. 
FG: Can I say something? 
Are you going to talk about me or you? 
  RSW: Once a shit, always a shit! 
FG: Because I want to get a standing ovation like everybody, so ... 
RSW: You're going to get one! You're going to get one! 
 I'm going to make it for you! 
FG: No, no. Wait a minute!

<title>Janine Benyus: Biomimicry's surprising lessons from nature's engineers</title> 
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: In this inspiring talk about recent developments in biomimicry, Janine Benyus provides heartening examples of ways in which nature is already influencing the products and systems we build.</description> 
It is a thrill to be here at a conference that's devoted to "Inspired by Nature" -- you can imagine. 
And I'm also thrilled to be in the foreplay section. 
Did you notice this section is foreplay? 
Because I get to talk about one of my favorite critters, which is the Western Grebe. You haven't lived until you've seen these guys do their courtship dance. 
I was on Bowman Lake in Glacier National Park, which is a long, skinny lake with sort of mountains upside down in it, and my partner and I have a rowing shell. 
And so we were rowing, and one of these Western Grebes came along. 
And what they do for their courtship dance is, they go together, the two of them, the two mates, and they begin to run underwater. 
They paddle faster, and faster, and faster, until they're going so fast that they literally lift up out of the water, and they're standing upright, sort of paddling the top of the water. 
And one of these Grebes came along while we were rowing. 
And so we're in a skull, and we're moving really, really quickly. 
And this Grebe, I think, sort of, mistaked us for a prospect, and started to run along the water next to us, in a courtship dance -- for miles. 
It would stop, and then start, and then stop, and then start. 
Now that is foreplay. 
 I came this close to changing species at that moment. 
Obviously, life can teach us something in the entertainment section. Life has a lot to teach us. 
But what I'd like to talk about today is what life might teach us in technology and in design. 
What's happened since the book came out -- the book was mainly about research in biomimicry -- and what's happened since then is architects, designers, engineers -- people who make our world -- have started to call and say, we want a biologist to sit at the design table to help us, in real time, become inspired. 
Or -- and this is the fun part for me -- we want you to take us out into the natural world. We'll come with a design challenge and we find the champion adapters in the natural world, who might inspire us. 
So this is a picture from a Galapagos trip that we took with some wastewater treatment engineers; they purify wastewater. 
And some of them were very resistant, actually, to being there. 
What they said to us at first was, you know, we already do biomimicry. 
We use bacteria to clean our water. And we said, well, that's not exactly being inspired by nature. 
That's bioprocessing, you know; that's bio-assisted technology: using an organism to do your wastewater treatment is an old, old technology called "domestication." 
This is learning something, learning an idea, from an organism and then applying it. 
And so they still weren't getting it. 
So we went for a walk on the beach and I said, well, give me one of your big problems. Give me a design challenge, sustainability speed bump, that's keeping you from being sustainable. 
And they said scaling, which is the build-up of minerals inside of pipes. 
And they said, you know what happens is, mineral -- just like at your house -- mineral builds up. 
And then the aperture closes, and we have to flush the pipes with toxins, or we have to dig them up. 
So if we had some way to stop this scaling -- and so I picked up some shells on the beach. And I asked them, what is scaling? What's inside your pipes? 
And they said, calcium carbonate. 
And I said, that's what this is; this is calcium carbonate. 
And they didn't know that. 
They didn't know that what a seashell is, it's templated by proteins, and then ions from the seawater crystallize in place to create a shell. 
So the same sort of a process, without the proteins, is happening on the inside of their pipes. They didn't know. 
This is not for lack of information; it's a lack of integration. 
You know, it's a silo, people in silos. They didn't know that the same thing was happening. So one of them thought about it and said, OK, well, if this is just crystallization that happens automatically out of seawater -- self-assembly -- then why aren't shells infinite in size? What stops the scaling? 
Why don't they just keep on going? 
And I said, well, in the same way that they exude a protein and it starts the crystallization -- and then they all sort of leaned in -- they let go of a protein that stops the crystallization. 
It literally adheres to the growing face of the crystal. 
And, in fact, there is a product called TPA that's mimicked that protein -- that stop-protein -- and it's an environmentally friendly way to stop scaling in pipes. 
That changed everything. From then on, you could not get these engineers back in the boat. 
The first day they would take a hike, and it was, click, click, click, click. Five minutes later they were back in the boat. 
We're done. You know, I've seen that island. 
After this, they were crawling all over. They would snorkel for as long as we would let them snorkel. 
What had happened was that they realized that there were organisms out there that had already solved the problems that they had spent their careers trying to solve. 
Learning about the natural world is one thing; learning from the natural world -- that's the switch. 
That's the profound switch. 
What they realized was that the answers to their questions are everywhere; they just needed to change the lenses with which they saw the world. 
3.8 billion years of field-testing. 
10 to 30 -- Craig Venter will probably tell you; I think there's a lot more than 30 million -- well-adapted solutions. 
The important thing for me is that these are solutions solved in context. 
And the context is the Earth -- the same context that we're trying to solve our problems in. 
So it's the conscious emulation of life's genius. 
It's not slavishly mimicking -- although Al is trying to get the hairdo going -- it's not a slavish mimicry; it's taking the design principles, the genius of the natural world, and learning something from it. 
Now, in a group with so many IT people, I do have to mention what I'm not going to talk about, and that is that your field is one that has learned an enormous amount from living things, on the software side. So there's computers that protect themselves, like an immune system, and we're learning from gene regulation and biological development. And we're learning from neural nets, 
genetic algorithms, evolutionary computing. 
That's on the software side. But what's interesting to me is that we haven't looked at this, as much. I mean, these machines are really not very high tech in my estimation in the sense that there's dozens and dozens of carcinogens in the water in Silicon Valley. 
So the hardware is not at all up to snuff in terms of what life would call a success. 
So what can we learn about making -- not just computers, but everything? 
The plane you came in, cars, the seats that you're sitting on. 
How do we redesign the world that we make, the human-made world? 
More importantly, what should we ask in the next 10 years? 
And there's a lot of cool technologies out there that life has. 
What's the syllabus? 
Three questions, for me, are key. 
How does life make things? 
This is the opposite; this is how we make things. 
It's called heat, beat and treat -- that's what material scientists call it. 
And it's carving things down from the top, with 96 percent waste left over and only 4 percent product. You heat it up; you beat it with high pressures; you use chemicals. OK. Heat, beat and treat. 
Life can't afford to do that. How does life make things? 
How does life make the most of things? 
That's a geranium pollen. 
And its shape is what gives it the function of being able to tumble through air so easily. Look at that shape. 
Life adds information to matter. 
In other words: structure. 
It gives it information. By adding information to matter, it gives it a function that's different than without that structure. 
And thirdly, how does life make things disappear into systems? 
Because life doesn't really deal in things; there are no things in the natural world divorced from their systems. 
Really quick syllabus. 
As I'm reading more and more now, and following the story, there are some amazing things coming up in the biological sciences. 
And at the same time, I'm listening to a lot of businesses and finding what their sort of grand challenges are. 
The two groups are not talking to each other. 
At all. 
What in the world of biology might be helpful at this juncture, to get us through this sort of evolutionary knothole that we're in? 
I'm going to try to go through 12, really quickly. 
One that's exciting to me is self-assembly. 
Now, you've heard about this in terms of nanotechnology. 
Back to that shell: the shell is a self-assembling material. 
On the lower left there is a picture of mother of pearl forming out of seawater. It's a layered structure that's mineral and then polymer, and it makes it very, very tough. 
It's twice as tough as our high-tech ceramics. 
But what's really interesting: unlike our ceramics that are in kilns, it happens in seawater. It happens near, in and near, the organism's body. 
This is Sandia National Labs. 
A guy named Jeff Brinker has found a way to have a self-assembling coding process. 
Imagine being able to make ceramics at room temperature by simply dipping something into a liquid, lifting it out of the liquid, and having evaporation force the molecules in the liquid together, so that they jigsaw together in the same way as this crystallization works. 
Imagine making all of our hard materials that way. 
Imagine spraying the precursors to a PV cell, to a solar cell, onto a roof, and having it self-assemble into a layered structure that harvests light. 
Here's an interesting one for the IT world: bio-silicon. This is a diatom, which is made of silicates. 
And so silicon, which we make right now -- it's part of our carcinogenic problem in the manufacture of our chips -- this is a bio-mineralization process that's now being mimicked. 
This is at UC Santa Barbara. Look at these diatoms. 
This is from Ernst Haeckel's work. 
Imagine being able to -- and, again, it's a templated process, and it solidifies out of a liquid process -- imagine being able to have that sort of structure coming out at room temperature. 
Imagine being able to make perfect lenses. 
On the left, this is a brittle star; it's covered with lenses that the people at Lucent Technologies have found have no distortion whatsoever. 
It's one of the most distortion-free lenses we know of. 
And there's many of them, all over its entire body. 
What's interesting, again, is that it self-assembles. 
A woman named Joanna Aizenberg, at Lucent, is now learning to do this in a low-temperature process to create these sort of lenses. She's also looking at fiber optics. 
That's a sea sponge that has a fiber optic. 
Down at the very base of it, there's fiber optics that work better than ours, actually, to move light, but you can tie them in a knot; they're incredibly flexible. 
Here's another big idea: CO2 as a feedstock. 
A guy named Geoff Coates, at Cornell, said to himself, you know, plants do not see CO2 as the biggest poison of our time. 
We see it that way. Plants are busy making long chains of starches and glucose, right, out of CO2. He's found a way -- he's found a catalyst -- and he's found a way to take CO2 and make it into polycarbonates. Biodegradable plastics out of CO2 -- how plant-like. 
Solar transformations: the most exciting one. 
There are people who are mimicking the energy-harvesting device inside of purple bacterium, the people at ASU. Even more interesting, lately, in the last couple of weeks, people have seen that there's an enzyme called hydrogenase that's able to evolve hydrogen from proton and electrons, and is able to take hydrogen up -- basically what's happening in a fuel cell, in the anode of a fuel cell 
and in a reversible fuel cell. 
In our fuel cells, we do it with platinum; life does it with a very, very common iron. 
And a team has now just been able to mimic that hydrogen-juggling hydrogenase. 
That's very exciting for fuel cells -- to be able to do that without platinum. 
Power of shape: here's a whale. We've seen that the fins of this whale have tubercles on them. And those little bumps actually increase efficiency in, for instance, the edge of an airplane -- increase efficiency by about 32 percent. 
Which is an amazing fossil fuel savings, if we were to just put that on the edge of a wing. 
Color without pigments: this peacock is creating color with shape. 
Light comes through, it bounces back off the layers; it's called thin-film interference. Imagine being able to self-assemble products with the last few layers playing with light to create color. 
Imagine being able to create a shape on the outside of a surface, so that it's self-cleaning with just water. That's what a leaf does. 
See that up-close picture? 
That's a ball of water, and those are dirt particles. 
And that's an up-close picture of a lotus leaf. 
There's a company making a product called Lotusan, which mimics -- when the building facade paint dries, it mimics the bumps in a self-cleaning leaf, and rainwater cleans the building. 
Water is going to be our big, grand challenge: quenching thirst. 
Here are two organisms that pull water. 
The one on the left is the Namibian beetle pulling water out of fog. 
The one on the right is a pill bug -- pulls water out of air, does not drink fresh water. 
Pulling water out of Monterey fog and out of the sweaty air in Atlanta, before it gets into a building, are key technologies. 
Separation technologies are going to be extremely important. 
What if we were to say, no more hard rock mining? 
What if we were to separate out metals from waste streams, small amounts of metals in water? That's what microbes do; they chelate metals out of water. 
There's a company here in San Francisco called MR3 that is embedding mimics of the microbes' molecules on filters to mine waste streams. 
Green chemistry is chemistry in water. 
We do chemistry in organic solvents. 
This is a picture of the spinnerets coming out of a spider and the silk being formed from a spider. Isn't that beautiful? 
Green chemistry is replacing our industrial chemistry with nature's recipe book. 
It's not easy, because life uses only a subset of the elements in the periodic table. 
And we use all of them, even the toxic ones. 
To figure out the elegant recipes that would take the small subset of the periodic table, and create miracle materials like that cell, is the task of green chemistry. 
Timed degradation: packaging that is good until you don't want it to be good anymore, and dissolves on cue. 
That's a mussel you can find in the waters out here, and the threads holding it to a rock are timed; at exactly two years, they begin to dissolve. 
Healing: this is a good one. 
That little guy over there is a tardigrade. 
There is a problem with vaccines around the world not getting to patients. And the reason is that the refrigeration somehow gets broken; what's called the "cold chain" gets broken. 
A guy named Bruce Rosner looked at the tardigrade -- which dries out completely, and yet stays alive for months and months and months, and is able to regenerate itself. 
And he found a way to dry out vaccines -- encase them in the same sort of sugar capsules as the tardigrade has within its cells -- meaning that vaccines no longer need to be refrigerated. 
They can be put in a glove compartment, OK. 
Learning from organisms. This is a session about water -- learning about organisms that can do without water, in order to create a vaccine that lasts and lasts and lasts without refrigeration. 
I'm not going to get to 12. 
But what I am going to do is tell you that the most important thing, besides all of these adaptations, is the fact that these organisms have figured out a way to do the amazing things they do while taking care of the place that's going to take care of their offspring. 
When they're involved in foreplay, they're thinking about something very, very important -- and that's having their genetic material remain, 10,000 generations from now. 
And that means finding a way to do what they do without destroying the place that'll take care of their offspring. 
That's the biggest design challenge. 
Luckily, there are millions and millions of geniuses willing to gift us with their best ideas. 
Good luck having a conversation with them. 
Thank you. 
 Chris Anderson: Talk about foreplay, I -- we need to get to 12, but really quickly. 
Janine Benyus: Oh really? 
CA: Yeah. Just like, you know, like the 10-second version of 10, 11 and 12. Because we just -- your slides are so gorgeous, and the ideas are so big, I can't stand to let you go down without seeing 10, 11 and 12. 
JB: OK, put this -- OK, I'll just hold this thing. OK, great. 
OK, so that's the healing one. 
Sensing and responding: feedback is a huge thing. 
This is a locust. There can be 80 million of them in a square kilometer, and yet they don't collide with one another. 
And yet we have 3.6 million car collisions a year. 
 Right. There's a person at Newcastle who has figured out that it's a very large neuron. 
And she's actually figuring out how to make a collision-avoidance circuitry based on this very large neuron in the locust. 
This is a huge and important one, number 11. 
And that's the growing fertility. 
That means, you know, net fertility farming. 
We should be growing fertility. And, oh yes -- we get food, too. 
Because we have to grow the capacity of this planet to create more and more opportunities for life. 
And really, that's what other organisms do as well. 
In ensemble, that's what whole ecosystems do: they create more and more opportunities for life. 
Our farming has done the opposite. 
So, farming based on how a prairie builds soil, ranching based on how a native ungulate herd actually increases the health of the range, even wastewater treatment based on how a marsh not only cleans the water, but creates incredibly sparkling productivity. 
This is the simple design brief. I mean, it looks simple because the system, over 3.8 billion years, has worked this out. 
That is, those organisms that have not been able to figure out how to enhance or sweeten their places, are not around to tell us about it. 
That's the twelfth one. 
Life -- and this is the secret trick; this is the magic trick -- life creates conditions conducive to life. 
It builds soil; it cleans air; it cleans water; it mixes the cocktail of gases that you and I need to live. 
And it does that in the middle of having great foreplay and meeting their needs. So it's not mutually exclusive. 
We have to find a way to meet our needs, while making of this place an Eden. 
CA: Janine, thank you so much.

<title>Malcolm Gladwell: Choice, happiness and spaghetti sauce</title> 
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: "Tipping Point" author Malcolm Gladwell gets inside the food industry's pursuit of the perfect spaghetti sauce -- and makes a larger argument about the nature of choice and happiness.</description> 
I think I was supposed to talk about my new book, which is called "Blink," and it's about snap judgments and first impressions. 
And it comes out in January, and I hope you all buy it in triplicate. 
But I was thinking about this, and I realized that although my new book makes me happy, and I think would make my mother happy, it's not really about happiness. 
So I decided instead, I would talk about someone who I think has done as much to make Americans happy as perhaps anyone over the last 20 years, a man who is a great personal hero of mine: someone by the name of Howard Moskowitz, who is most famous for reinventing spaghetti sauce. 
Howard's about this high, and he's round, and he's in his 60s, and he has big huge glasses and thinning gray hair, and he has a kind of wonderful exuberance and vitality, and he has a parrot, and he loves the opera, and he's a great aficionado of medieval history. 
And by profession, he's a psychophysicist. 
Now, I should tell you that I have no idea what psychophysics is, although at some point in my life, I dated a girl for two years who was getting her doctorate in psychophysics. 
Which should tell you something about that relationship.  As far as I know, psychophysics is about measuring things. 
And Howard is very interested in measuring things. 
And he graduated with his doctorate from Harvard, and he set up a little consulting shop in White Plains, New York. 
And one of his first clients was Pepsi. 
And Pepsi came to Howard and they said, "You know, there's this new thing called aspartame, and we would like to make Diet Pepsi. 
We'd like you to figure out how much aspartame we should put in each can of Diet Pepsi in order to have the perfect drink." 
Now that sounds like an incredibly straightforward question to answer, and that's what Howard thought. Because Pepsi told him, "We're working with a band between eight and 12 percent. 
Anything below eight percent sweetness is not sweet enough; anything above 12 percent sweetness is too sweet. 
We want to know: what's the sweet spot between 8 and 12?" 
Now, if I gave you this problem to do, you would all say, it's very simple. 
What we do is you make up a big experimental batch of Pepsi, at every degree of sweetness -- eight percent, 8.1, 8.2, 8.3, all the way up to 12 -- and we try this out with thousands of people, and we plot the results on a curve, and we take the most popular concentration, right? Really simple. 
Howard does the experiment, and he gets the data back, and he plots it on a curve, and all of a sudden he realizes it's not a nice bell curve. 
In fact, the data doesn't make any sense. 
It's a mess. It's all over the place. 
Now, most people in that business, in the world of testing food and such, are not dismayed when the data comes back a mess. 
They think, "Well, you know, figuring out what people think about cola's not that easy." 
"You know, maybe we made an error somewhere along the way." 
"You know, let's just make an educated guess," and they simply point and they go for 10 percent, right in the middle. 
Howard is not so easily placated. 
Howard is a man of a certain degree of intellectual standards. 
And this was not good enough for him, and this question bedeviled him for years. 
And he would think it through and say, "What was wrong? 
Why could we not make sense of this experiment with Diet Pepsi?" 
And one day, he was sitting in a diner in White Plains, about to go trying to dream up some work for Nescafé. 
And suddenly, like a bolt of lightning, the answer came to him. 
And that is, that when they analyzed the Diet Pepsi data, they were asking the wrong question. 
They were looking for the perfect Pepsi, and they should have been looking for the perfect Pepsis. Trust me. 
This was an enormous revelation. 
This was one of the most brilliant breakthroughs in all of food science. 
Howard immediately went on the road, and he would go to conferences around the country, and he would stand up and say, "You had been looking for the perfect Pepsi. You're wrong. 
You should be looking for the perfect Pepsis." 
And people would look at him blankly and say, "What are you talking about? Craziness." 
And they would say, "Move! Next!" 
Tried to get business, nobody would hire him -- he was obsessed, though, and he talked about it and talked about it. 
Howard loves the Yiddish expression "To a worm in horseradish, the world is horseradish." 
This was his horseradish.  He was obsessed with it! 
And finally, he had a breakthrough. 
and they said, "Doctor Moskowitz, we want to make the perfect pickle." 
And he said, "There is no perfect pickle; there are only perfect pickles." 
And he came back to them and he said, "You don't just need to improve your regular; you need to create zesty." 
And that's where we got zesty pickles. 
Then the next person came to him: Campbell's Soup. 
And this was even more important. 
In fact, Campbell's Soup is where Howard made his reputation. 
Campbell's made Prego, and Prego, in the early 80s, was struggling next to Ragù, which was the dominant spaghetti sauce of the 70s and 80s. 
In the industry -- I don't know whether you care about this, or how much time I have to go into this. 
But it was, technically speaking -- this is an aside -- Prego is a better tomato sauce than Ragù. 
The quality of the tomato paste is much better; the spice mix is far superior; it adheres to the pasta in a much more pleasing way. 
In fact, they would do the famous bowl test back in the 70s with Ragù and Prego. 
You'd have a plate of spaghetti, and you would pour it on, right? 
And the Ragù would all go to the bottom, and the Prego would sit on top. 
That's called "adherence." 
And, anyway, despite the fact that they were far superior in adherence, and the quality of their tomato paste, Prego was struggling. 
So they came to Howard, and they said, fix us. 
And Howard looked at their product line, and he said, what you have is a dead tomato society. 
So he said, this is what I want to do. 
And he got together with the Campbell's soup kitchen, and he made 45 varieties of spaghetti sauce. 
And he varied them according to every conceivable way that you can vary tomato sauce: by sweetness, by level of garlic, by tomatoey-ness, by tartness, by sourness, by visible solids -- my favorite term in the spaghetti sauce business.  Every conceivable way you can vary spaghetti sauce, he varied spaghetti sauce. 
And then he took this whole raft of 45 spaghetti sauces, and he went on the road. 
He went to New York, to Chicago, he went to Jacksonville, to Los Angeles. 
And he brought in people by the truckload into big halls. 
And he sat them down for two hours, and over the course of that two hours, he gave them ten bowls. 
Ten small bowls of pasta, with a different spaghetti sauce on each one. 
And after they ate each bowl, they had to rate, from 0 to 100, how good they thought the spaghetti sauce was. 
At the end of that process, after doing it for months and months, he had a mountain of data about how the American people feel about spaghetti sauce. 
And then he analyzed the data. 
Did he look for the most popular variety of spaghetti sauce? 
No! Howard doesn't believe that there is such a thing. 
Instead, he looked at the data, and he said, let's see if we can group all these different data points into clusters. 
Let's see if they congregate around certain ideas. 
And sure enough, if you sit down, and you analyze all this data on spaghetti sauce, you realize that all Americans fall into one of three groups. 
There are people who like their spaghetti sauce plain; there are people who like their spaghetti sauce spicy; and there are people who like it extra chunky. 
And of those three facts, the third one was the most significant, because at the time, in the early 1980s, if you went to a supermarket, you would not find extra-chunky spaghetti sauce. 
And Prego turned to Howard, and they said, "You're telling me that one third of Americans crave extra-chunky spaghetti sauce and yet no one is servicing their needs?" And he said "Yes!" 
 And Prego then went back, and completely reformulated their spaghetti sauce, and came out with a line of extra chunky that immediately and completely took over the spaghetti sauce business in this country. 
And over the next 10 years, they made 600 million dollars off their line of extra-chunky sauces. 
Everyone else in the industry looked at what Howard had done, and they said, "Oh my god! We've been thinking all wrong!" 
And that's when you started to get seven different kinds of vinegar, and 14 different kinds of mustard, and 71 different kinds of olive oil. 
And then eventually even Ragù hired Howard, and Howard did the exact same thing for Ragù that he did for Prego. 
And today, if you go to a really good supermarket, do you know how many Ragùs there are? 36! 
In six varieties: Cheese, Light, Robusto, Rich &amp; Hearty, Old World Traditional -- That's Howard's doing. That is Howard's gift to the American people. 
Now why is that important? 
It is, in fact, enormously important. I'll explain to you why. 
What Howard did is he fundamentally changed the way the food industry thinks about making you happy. 
Assumption number one in the food industry used to be that the way to find out what people want to eat, what will make people happy, is to ask them. 
And for years and years and years, Ragù and Prego would have focus groups, and they would sit you down, and they would say, "What do you want in a spaghetti sauce? Tell us what you want in a spaghetti sauce." 
And for all those years -- 20, 30 years -- through all those focus group sessions, no one ever said they wanted extra-chunky. 
Even though at least a third of them, deep in their hearts, actually did. 
 People don't know what they want! 
As Howard loves to say, "The mind knows not what the tongue wants." 
It's a mystery! 
And a critically important step in understanding our own desires and tastes is to realize that we cannot always explain what we want, deep down. 
If I asked all of you, for example, in this room, what you want in a coffee, you know what you'd say? Every one of you would say, "I want a dark, rich, hearty roast." 
It's what people always say when you ask them. 
"What do you like?" "Dark, rich, hearty roast!" 
What percentage of you actually like a dark, rich, hearty roast? 
According to Howard, somewhere between 25 and 27 percent of you. 
Most of you like milky, weak coffee.  But you will never, ever say to someone who asks you what you want that "I want a milky, weak coffee." 
So that's number one thing that Howard did. 
Number two thing that Howard did is he made us realize -- it's another very critical point -- he made us realize the importance of what he likes to call "horizontal segmentation." 
Why is this critical? 
Because this is the way the food industry thought before Howard. 
What were they obsessed with in the early 80s? They were obsessed with mustard. 
In particular, they were obsessed with the story of Grey Poupon. 
Used to be, there were two mustards: French's and Gulden's. 
What were they? Yellow mustard. What's in it? 
Yellow mustard seeds, turmeric, and paprika. That was mustard. 
Grey Poupon came along, with a Dijon. Right? 
Much more volatile brown mustard seed, some white wine, a nose hit, much more delicate aromatics. And what do they do? 
They put it in a little tiny glass jar, with a wonderful enameled label on it, made it look French, even though it's made in Oxnard, California. 
And instead of charging a dollar fifty for the eight-ounce bottle, the way that French's and Gulden's did, they decided to charge four dollars. 
And they had those ads. 
With the guy in the Rolls Royce, eating the Grey Poupon. 
Another pulls up, and says, "Do you have any Grey Poupon?" 
And the whole thing, after they did that, Grey Poupon takes off! 
Takes over the mustard business! 
And everyone's take-home lesson from that was that the way to make people happy is to give them something that is more expensive, something to aspire to. 
It's to make them turn their back on what they think they like now, and reach out for something higher up the mustard hierarchy. 
A better mustard! A more expensive mustard! 
A mustard of more sophistication and culture and meaning. 
And Howard looked to that and said, "That's wrong!" 
Mustard does not exist on a hierarchy. 
Mustard exists, just like tomato sauce, on a horizontal plane. 
There is no good mustard or bad mustard. 
There is no perfect mustard or imperfect mustard. 
There are only different kinds of mustards that suit different kinds of people. 
He fundamentally democratized the way we think about taste. 
And for that, as well, we owe Howard Moskowitz a huge vote of thanks. 
Third thing that Howard did, and perhaps the most important, is Howard confronted the notion of the Platonic dish.  What do I mean by that? 
For the longest time in the food industry, there was a sense that there was one way, a perfect way, to make a dish. 
You go to Chez Panisse, they give you the red-tail sashimi with roasted pumpkin seeds in a something something reduction. 
They don't give you five options on the reduction. 
They don't say, "Do you want the extra-chunky reduction, or ...?" No! 
You just get the reduction. Why? 
Because the chef at Chez Panisse has a Platonic notion about red-tail sashimi. 
"This is the way it ought to be." And she serves it that way time and time again, and if you quarrel with her, she will say, "You know what? You're wrong! This is the best way it ought to be in this restaurant." 
Now that same idea fueled the commercial food industry as well. 
They had a Platonic notion of what tomato sauce was. 
And where did that come from? It came from Italy. 
Italian tomato sauce is what? It's blended; it's thin. 
The culture of tomato sauce was thin. 
When we talked about "authentic tomato sauce" in the 1970s, we talked about Italian tomato sauce, we talked about the earliest Ragùs, which had no visible solids, right? 
Which were thin, you just put a little bit and it sunk down to the bottom of the pasta. 
That's what it was. And why were we attached to that? 
Because we thought that what it took to make people happy was to provide them with the most culturally authentic tomato sauce, A. 
And B, we thought that if we gave them the culturally authentic tomato sauce, then they would embrace it. 
And that's what would please the maximum number of people. 
In other words, people in the cooking world were looking for cooking universals. 
They were looking for one way to treat all of us. 
And it's good reason for them to be obsessed with the idea of universals, because all of science, through the 19th century and much of the 20th, was obsessed with universals. 
Psychologists, medical scientists, economists were all interested in finding out the rules that govern the way all of us behave. 
But that changed, right? 
What is the great revolution in science of the last 10, 15 years? 
It is the movement from the search for universals to the understanding of variability. 
Now in medical science, we don't want to know, necessarily, just how cancer works, we want to know how your cancer is different from my cancer. 
I guess my cancer different from your cancer. 
Genetics has opened the door to the study of human variability. 
What Howard Moskowitz was doing was saying, "This same revolution needs to happen in the world of tomato sauce." 
And for that, we owe him a great vote of thanks. 
I'll give you one last illustration of variability, and that is -- oh, I'm sorry. 
Howard not only believed that, but he took it a second step, which was to say that when we pursue universal principles in food, we aren't just making an error; we are actually doing ourselves a massive disservice. 
And the example he used was coffee. 
And coffee is something he did a lot of work with, with Nescafé. 
If I were to ask all of you to try and come up with a brand of coffee -- a type of coffee, a brew -- that made all of you happy, and then I asked you to rate that coffee, the average score in this room for coffee would be about 60 on a scale of 0 to 100. 
If, however, you allowed me to break you into coffee clusters, maybe three or four coffee clusters, and I could make coffee just for each of those individual clusters, your scores would go from 60 to 75 or 78. 
The difference between coffee at 60 and coffee at 78 is a difference between coffee that makes you wince, and coffee that makes you deliriously happy. 
That is the final, and I think most beautiful lesson, of Howard Moskowitz: that in embracing the diversity of human beings, we will find a surer way to true happiness. 
Thank you.

<title>Richard Baraniuk: The birth of the open-source learning revolution</title> 
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: In 2006, open-learning visionary Richard Baraniuk explains the vision behind Connexions (now called OpenStax), an open-source, online education system. It cuts out the textbook, allowing teachers to share and modify course materials freely, anywhere in the world.</description> 
I'm Rich Baraniuk and what I'd like to talk a little bit about today are some ideas that I think have just tremendous resonance with all the things that have been talked about the last two days. 
So many different points of resonance that it's going to be difficult to bring them all up, but I'll try to do my best. 
Does anybody remember these? 
 OK, so these are LP records and they've been replaced, right? 
They've been swept away over the last two decades by these types of world-flattening digitization technologies, right? 
And I think it was best witnessed when Thomas was playing the music as we came in the room today. 
What's happened in the music world is there's a culture, or an ecosystem that's been created that, if you take some words from Apple, the catchphrase -- that we create, rip, mix and burn. 
What I mean by that is that anyone in the world is free and allowed to create new music and musical ideas. 
Anyone in the world is allowed to rip or copy musical ideas, use them in innovative ways. 
Anyone is allowed to mix them in different types of ways, draw connections between musical ideas, and people can burn them or create final products and continue the circle. 
And what that's done is it's created, like I said, a vibrant community that's very inclusive, with people continually working to connect musical ideas, innovate them and keep things constantly up to date. 
Today's hit single is not last year's hit single. 
But I'm not here to talk about music today. 
I'm here to talk about books. 
In particular, textbooks and the kind of educational materials that we use every day in school. 
Has anyone here ever been to school? 
 OK, does anybody realize there's a crisis in our schools, around the world? 
I'm not going to spend too much time on that, but what I want to talk about is some of the disconnects that appear when an author publishes a book. 
That in fact, the publishing process -- just because of the fact that it's complicated, it's heavy, books are expensive -- creates a sort of a wall between authors of books and the ultimate users of books, be they teachers, students or just general readers. 
And this is even more true if you happen to speak a language other than one of the world's major languages, and especially English. 
I'm going to call these people below the barrier "shutouts" because they're really shut out of the process of being able to share their knowledge with the world. 
And so what I want to talk about today is trying to take these ideas that we've seen in the musical culture and try to bring these towards reinventing the way we think about writing books, using them and teaching from them. 
So, that's what I'd like to talk about and, really, how we get from where we are now to where we need to go. 
The first thing I'd like you to do is a little thought experiment. Imagine taking all the world's books. 
OK, everybody imagine books and imagine just tearing out the pages. 
So, liberating these pages and imagine digitizing them and then storing them in a vast, interconnected, global repository. 
Think of it as a massive iTunes for book-type content. 
And then take that material and imagine making it all open, so that people can modify it, play with it, improve it. 
Imagine making it free, so that anyone in the world can have access to all of this knowledge, and imagine using information technology so that you can update this content, improve it, play with it, on a timescale that's more on the order of seconds instead of years. 
Instead of editions of a book coming out every two years, imagine them coming out every 25 seconds. 
So, imagine we could do that and imagine we could put people into this. 
So that we could truly build an ecosystem with not just authors, but all the people who could be or want to be authors in all the different languages of the world, and I think if you could do this, it would be called -- I'm just going to refer to it as a knowledge ecosystem. 
So, really, this is the dream, and in a sense what you can think of it is we're trying to enable anyone in the world, I mean anyone in the world --  to be their own educational DJ, creating educational materials, sharing them with the world, constantly innovating on them. 
So, this is the dream. 
Over the last six-and-a-half years, we've been working really hard at Rice University on a project called Connexions, and so what I'd like to do for the rest of the talk is just tell you a little bit about what people are doing with Connexions, which you can kind of think of as the counterpoint to Nicholas Negroponte's talk yesterday, where they're working on the hardware of bringing education to the world. 
We're working on the open-source tools and the content. 
So, that's sort of to put it in perspective here. 
So, create. What are some of the people that are using these kind of tools? 
Well, the first thing is, there's a community of engineering professors, from Cambridge to Kyoto, who are developing engineering content in electrical engineering to develop what you can think of as a massive, super textbook that covers the entire area of electrical engineering. 
And not only that -- it can be customized for use in each of their own individual institutions. 
If people like Kitty Jones, a shut-out -- a private music teacher and mom from Champagne, Illinois, who wanted to share her fantastic music content with the world, on how to teach kids how to play music -- Her material is now used over 600,000 times per month. 
Tremendous use. 
In fact, a lot of this use coming from United States K-12 schools, because anyone who's involved in a school scale back, the first thing that's cut is the music curriculum. 
And so this is just indicating the tremendous thirst for this kind of open, free content. 
A lot of teachers are using this stuff. 
What about ripping? What about copying, reusing? 
A team of volunteers at the University of Texas at El Paso -- graduate students translating this engineering super textbook ideas. 
And within about a week, having this be some of our most popular material in widespread use all over Latin America, and in particular in Mexico, because of the open, extensible nature of this. 
People, volunteers and even companies that are translating materials into Asian languages like Chinese, Japanese and Thai, to spread the knowledge even further. 
OK, what about people who are mixing? What does "mixing" mean? 
"Mixing" means building customized courses, means building customized books. 
Companies like National Instruments, who are embedding very powerful, interactive simulations into the materials, so that we can go way beyond our regular kind of textbook to an experience that all the teaching materials are things you can actually interact with and play around with and actually learn as you do. 
We've been working with Teachers Without Borders, who are very interested in mixing our materials. 
They're going to be using Connexions as their platform to develop and deliver teaching materials for teaching teachers how to teach in 84 countries around the world. 
TWB is currently in Iraq, training 20,000 teachers supported by USAID. 
And to them, this idea of being able to remix and customize to the local context is extraordinarily important, because just providing free content to people has actually been likened by people in the developing world to a kind of cultural imperialism -- that if you don't empower people with the ability to re-contextualize the material, translate it into their own language and take ownership of it, 
it's not good. 
OK, other organizations we've been working with, UC Merced -- people know about UC Merced. 
It's a new university in California, in the Central Valley, working very closely with community colleges. They're actually developing a lot of their science and engineering curriculum to spread widely around the world in our system. 
And they're also trying to develop all of their software tools completely open-source. 
We've been working with AMD, which has a project called 50x15, which is trying to bring Internet connectivity to 50 percent of the world's population by 2015. 
We're going to be providing content to them in a whole range of different languages. 
And we've also been working with a number of other organizations. 
In particular, a bunch of the projects that are funded by Hewlett Foundation, who have taken a real leadership role in this area of open content. 
OK, burn -- I think this is, sort of, quite interesting. 
"Burn" is the idea of trying to create the physical instantiation And I think a lot of you received -- I think all of you received one of these music books in your gift pack. 
A little present for you. 
Just to tell you quickly about it: this is an engineering textbook. 
It's about 300 pages long, hardbound. 
This costs -- anybody guess? 
How much would it cost in a bookstore? 
 65 dollars. 
Richard Baraniuk: OK. This costs 22 dollars to the student. 
Why does it cost 22 dollars? 
Because it's published on demand and it's developed from this repository of open materials. 
If this book were to be published by a regular publisher, it would cost at least 122 dollars. 
So what we're seeing is moving this burning or publication process from the regular, sort of single-authored book that are modular, that are customized to each individual class and published on demand very inexpensively, either pushed out through Amazon or published directly through an on-demand press, like QOOP. 
And I think that this is an extraordinarily interesting area because there is tremendous area under this long tail in publishing. 
We're not talking about the Harry Potter end, right at the left side. 
We're talking about books on hypergeometric partial differential equations. 
Books that might sell 100 copies a year, 1,000 copies a year. 
There is tremendous sustaining revenue under this long tail to sustain open projects like ours, but also to sustain this new emergence of on-demand publishers, like QOOP, who produced these two books. 
And I think one of the things that you should take away from this talk is that there's an impending cut-out-the-middle-man disintermediation, that's going to be happening in the publishing industry. 
And it's going to reach a crescendo over the next few years, and I think that it's for our benefit, really, and for the world's benefit. 
OK, so what are the enablers? 
What's really making all of this happen? 
There's tons of technology, and the only piece of technology that I really want to talk about is XML. 
How many people know about XML? 
Oh, great. So it's the future of the web, right? 
It's semantic representation of content. 
And what you can really think of XML in this case is it's the packaging that we're putting around these pages. 
Remember we took the book, tore the pages out? 
Well, what the XML is going to do is it's going to turn those pages into Lego blocks. 
XML are the nubs on the Lego that allow us to combine the content together in a myriad different ways, and it provides us a framework to share content. 
So, it lets you take this ecosystem in its primordial state of all this content, all the pages you've torn out of books, and create highly sophisticated learning machines: books, courses, course packs. 
It gives you the ability to personalize the learning experience to each individual student, so that every student can have a book or a course that's customized to their learning style, their context, their language and the things that excite them. 
It lets you reuse the same materials in multiple different ways, and surprising new ways. 
It lets you interconnect ideas, indicating how fields relate to each other. 
And I'll just give you my personal story. 
We came up with this six-and-a-half years ago because I teach the stuff in the red box. 
And my day job, as Chris said -- I'm an electrical engineering professor. 
I teach signal processing and my challenge was to show that this math -- Wow, about half of you have already fallen asleep just looking at the equation. 
 is actually the center of this tremendously powerful web that links technology -- that links really cool applications like music synthesizers to tremendous economic opportunities, but also governed by intellectual property. 
is there was no way that I, as an engineer, could write this book that would get all of this across. 
We needed a community to do it and we needed new tools to be able to interconnect these ideas. 
And I think that really, in a sense, what we're trying to do is make Minsky's dream come to a reality, where you can imagine all the books in a library actually starting to talk to each other. 
And people who are teachers out here -- whoever taught, you know this -- it's the interconnections between ideas that teaching is really all about. 
OK, back to math. 
Imagine -- this is possible: that every single equation that you click on in one of your new e-texts is something that you're going to be able to explore and experiment with. 
So imagine your kid's algebra textbook in seventh grade. 
You can click on every single equation and bring up a little tool to be able to experiment with it, tinker with it, understand it. 
Because we really don't understand until we do. 
The same type of mark-up, like MathML, for chemistry. 
Imagine chemistry textbooks that actually understand the structure of how molecules are formed. 
Imagine Music XML that actually lets you delve into the semantic structure of music, play with it, understand it. 
It's no wonder that everybody's getting into it, right? 
Even the three wise men. 
 OK, the second big enabler, and this is where I told a big lie. 
The second big enabler is intellectual property. 
Because, in fact, I got up here and I talked about how great the music culture is. 
We can share and rip, mix and burn, but in fact, that's all illegal. 
And we would be accused of [piracy] for doing that, because this music has been propertized. 
It's now owned, much of it by big industries. 
So, really, the key thing here is we can't let this happen. 
We can't let this Napster thing happen here. 
So, what we have to do is get it right from the very beginning. 
And what we have to do is find an intellectual property framework that makes sharing safe and makes it easily understandable. And the inspiration here is taken from open-source software. 
Things like Linux and the GPL. 
The Creative Commons licenses. 
How many people have heard of creative commons? 
At the bottom of every piece of material in Connexions and in lots of other projects, you can find their logo. 
Clicking on that logo takes you to an absolute no-nonsense, human-readable document, a deed, that tells you exactly what you can do with this content. 
In fact, you're free to share it, to do all of these things: to copy it, to change it, even to make commercial use of it, as long as you attribute the author. 
Because in academic publishing and much of educational publishing, it's really this idea of sharing knowledge and making impact. 
That's why people write, not necessarily making bucks. 
We're not talking about Harry Potter, right? 
We're at the long tail end here. 
Behind that is the legal code, very carefully constructed. 
And Creative Commons is taking off -- over 43 million things out there, licensed with a Creative Commons license. 
Not just text, but music, images, video. 
And there's actually a tremendous uptake of the number of people that are actually licensing music to make it free for people who do this whole idea of re-sampling, ripping, mixing, burning and sharing. 
OK, I'd like to conclude with just the last few points. 
So, we've built this idea of a commons. People are using it. 
We get over 500,000 unique visitors per month, just to our particular site. 
MIT OpenCourseWare, which is another large open-content site, gets a similar number of hits. 
But how do we protect this? 
How do we protect it into the future? 
And the first thing that people are probably thinking is quality control, right? 
Because we're saying that anybody can contribute things to this commons. 
Anybody can contribute anything. 
So that could be a problem. 
It didn't take long until people started contributing materials, for example, on lingerie, which is actually a pretty good module. 
The only problem is it's plagiarized from a major French feminist journal, and when you go to the supposed course website, it points to a lingerie-selling website. 
So this is a little bit of a problem. 
So we clearly need some kind of idea of quality control You come to TED. Why do you come to TED? 
Because Chris and his team have ensured that things are very, very high quality, right? 
And so we need to be able to do the same thing. 
And we need to be able to design structures, and what we're doing is designing social software to enable anyone to build their own peer review process, and we call these things "lenses." 
And basically what they allow is anyone out there can develop their own peer-review process, so that they can focus on the content in the repository that they think is really important. 
And you can think of TED as a potential lens. 
So I'd just like to end by saying: you can really view this as a call to action. 
Connexions and open content is all about sharing knowledge. 
All of you here are tremendously imbued with tremendous amounts of knowledge, and what I'd like to do is invite each and every one of you to contribute to this project and other projects of its type, because I think together we can truly change the landscape of education and educational publishing. 
So, thanks very much.

<title>Rives: If I controlled the Internet</title> 
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: How many poets could cram eBay, Friendster and Monster.com into 3-minute poem worthy of a standing ovation? Enjoy Rives' unique talent.</description> 
I wrote this poem after hearing a pretty well known actress tell a very well known interviewer on television, "I'm really getting into the Internet lately. 
I just wish it were more organized." 
So ... 
 If I controlled the Internet, you could auction your broken heart on eBay. 
Take the money; go to Amazon; buy a phonebook for a country you've never been to -- call folks at random until you find someone who flirts really well in a foreign language. 
 If I were in charge of the Internet, you could Mapquest your lover's mood swings. 
Hang left at cranky, right at preoccupied, U-turn on silent treatment, all the way back to tongue kissing and good lovin'. 
You could navigate and understand every emotional intersection. 
Some days, I'm as shallow as a baking pan, but I still stretch miles in all directions. 
If I owned the Internet, Napster, Monster and Friendster.com would be one big website. 
That way you could listen to cool music while you pretend to look for a job and you're really just chattin' with your pals. 
 Heck, if I ran the Web, you could email dead people. 
 They would not email you back  -- but you'd get an automated reply. 
 Their name in your inbox  -- it's all you wanted anyway. 
And a message saying, "Hey, it's me. I miss you. 
 Listen, you'll see being dead is dandy. 
Now you go back to raising kids and waging peace and craving candy." 
If I designed the Internet, childhood.com would be a loop of a boy in an orchard, with a ski pole for a sword, trashcan lid for a shield, shouting, "I am the emperor of oranges. 
I am the emperor of oranges. I am the emperor of oranges." 
Now follow me, OK? 
 Grandma.com would be a recipe for biscuits and spit-bath instructions. 
One, two, three. 
That links with hotdiggitydog.com. 
That is my grandfather. 
They take you to gruff-ex-cop-on-his-fourth-marriage.dad. He forms an attachment to kind-of-ditzy-but-still-sends-ginger-snaps-for-Christmas.mom, who downloads the boy in the orchard, the emperor of oranges, who grows up to be me -- the guy who usually goes too far. 
So if I were emperor of the Internet, I guess I'd still be mortal, huh? 
But at that point, I would probably already have the lowest possible mortgage and the most enlarged possible penis  -- so I would outlaw spam on my first day in office. 
I wouldn't need it. 
I'd be like some kind of Internet genius, and me, I'd like to upgrade to deity and maybe just like that -- pop! -- I'd go wireless. 
 Huh? Maybe Google would hire this. 
I could zip through your servers and firewalls like a virus until the World Wide Web is as wise, as wild and as organized as I think a modern-day miracle/oracle can get, but, ooh-eee, you want to bet just how whack and un-PC your Mac or PC is going to be when I'm rocking hot-shit-hot-shot-god.net? 
I guess it's just like life. 
It is not a question of if you can -- it's: do ya? 
We can interfere with the interface. 
We can make "You've got Hallelujah" the national anthem of cyberspace every lucky time we log on. 
You don't say a prayer. 
You don't write a psalm. 
You don't chant an "om." 
You send one blessed email to whomever you're thinking of at dah-da-la-dat-da-dah-da-la-dat.com. 
Thank you, TED.

<title>Seth Godin: How to get your ideas to spread</title> 
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: In a world of too many options and too little time, our obvious choice is to just ignore the ordinary stuff. Marketing guru Seth Godin spells out why, when it comes to getting our attention, bad or bizarre ideas are more successful than boring ones.</description> 
I'm going to give you four specific examples, about how a company called Silk tripled their sales; how an artist named Jeff Koons went from being a nobody to making a whole bunch of money and having a lot of impact; to how Frank Gehry redefined what it meant to be an architect. 
And one of my biggest failures as a marketer in the last few years -- a record label I started that had a CD called "Sauce." 
Before I can do that I've got to tell you about sliced bread, and a guy named Otto Rohwedder. 
Now, before sliced bread was invented in the 1910s I wonder what they said? 
Like the greatest invention since the telegraph or something. 
But this guy named Otto Rohwedder invented sliced bread, and he focused, like most inventors did, on the patent part and the making part. 
And the thing about the invention of sliced bread is this -- that for the first 15 years after sliced bread was available no one bought it; no one knew about it; it was a complete and total failure. 
And the reason is that until Wonder came along and figured out how to spread the idea of sliced bread, no one wanted it. 
That the success of sliced bread, like the success of almost everything we've talked about at this conference, is not always about what the patent is like, or what the factory is like -- it's about can you get your idea to spread, or not. 
And I think that the way you're going to get what you want, or cause the change that you want to change, to happen, is to figure out a way to get your ideas to spread. 
And it doesn't matter to me whether you're running a coffee shop or you're an intellectual, or you're in business, or you're flying hot air balloons. 
I think that all this stuff applies to everybody regardless of what we do. 
That what we are living in is a century of idea diffusion. 
That people who can spread ideas, regardless of what those ideas are, win. 
When I talk about it I usually pick business, because they make the best pictures that you can put in your presentation, and because it's the easiest sort of way to keep score. 
But I want you to forgive me when I use these examples because I'm talking about anything that you decide to spend your time to do. 
At the heart of spreading ideas is TV and stuff like TV. 
TV and mass media made it really easy to spread ideas in a certain way. 
I call it the "TV-industrial complex." 
The way the TV-industrial complex works, is you buy some ads, interrupt some people, that gets you distribution. 
You use the distribution you get to sell more products. 
You take the profit from that to buy more ads. 
And it goes around and around and around, the same way that the military-industrial complex worked a long time ago. 
That model of, and we heard it yesterday -- if we could only get onto the homepage of Google, if we could only figure out how to get promoted there, or grab that person by the throat, and tell them about what we want to do. 
If we did that then everyone would pay attention, and we would win. 
Well, this TV-industrial complex informed my entire childhood and probably yours. 
I mean, all of these products succeeded because someone figured out how to touch people in a way they weren't expecting, in a way they didn't necessarily want, with an ad, over and over again until they bought it. 
And the thing that's happened is, they canceled the TV-industrial complex. 
That just over the last few years, what anybody who markets anything has discovered is that it's not working the way that it used to. 
This picture is really fuzzy, I apologize; I had a bad cold when I took it. 
But the product in the blue box in the center is my poster child. 
I go to the deli; I'm sick; I need to buy some medicine. 
The brand manager for that blue product spent 100 million dollars trying to interrupt me in one year. 
100 million dollars interrupting me with TV commercials and magazine ads and Spam and coupons and shelving allowances and spiff -- all so I could ignore every single message. 
And I ignored every message because I don't have a pain reliever problem. 
I buy the stuff in the yellow box because I always have. 
And I'm not going to invest a minute of my time to solve her problem, because I don't care. 
Here's a magazine called "Hydrate." It's 180 pages about water. 
 Articles about water, ads about water. 
Imagine what the world was like 40 years ago, with just the Saturday Evening Post and Time and Newsweek. 
Now there are magazines about water. 
New product from Coke Japan: water salad. 
 Coke Japan comes out with a new product every three weeks, because they have no idea what's going to work and what's not. 
I couldn't have written this better myself. It came out four days ago -- I circled the important parts so you can see them here. 
They've come out... Arby's is going to spend 85 million dollars promoting an oven mitt with the voice of Tom Arnold, hoping that that will get people to go to Arby's and buy a roast beef sandwich. 
 Now, I had tried to imagine what could possibly be in an animated TV commercial featuring Tom Arnold, that would get you to get in your car, drive across town and buy a roast beef sandwich. 
 Now, this is Copernicus, and he was right, when he was talking to anyone who needs to hear your idea. 
"The world revolves around me." Me, me, me, me. My favorite person -- me. 
I don't want to get email from anybody; I want to get "memail." 
 So consumers, and I don't just mean people who buy stuff at the Safeway; I mean people at the Defense Department who might buy something, or people at, you know, the New Yorker who might print your article. 
Consumers don't care about you at all; they just don't care. 
Part of the reason is -- they've got way more choices than they used to, and way less time. 
And in a world where we have too many choices and too little time, the obvious thing to do is just ignore stuff. 
And my parable here is you're driving down the road and you see a cow, and you keep driving because you've seen cows before. 
Cows are invisible. Cows are boring. 
Who's going to stop and pull over and say -- "Oh, look, a cow." Nobody. 
 But if the cow was purple -- isn't that a great special effect? 
I could do that again if you want. 
If the cow was purple, you'd notice it for a while. 
I mean, if all cows were purple you'd get bored with those, too. 
The thing that's going to decide what gets talked about, what gets done, what gets changed, what gets purchased, what gets built, is: "Is it remarkable?" 
And "remarkable" is a really cool word, because we think it just means "neat," but it also means "worth making a remark about." 
And that is the essence of where idea diffusion is going. 
That two of the hottest cars in the United States is a 55,000-dollar giant car, big enough to hold a Mini in its trunk. 
People are paying full price for both, and the only thing they have in common is that they don't have anything in common. 
 Every week, the number one best-selling DVD in America changes. 
It's never "The Godfather," it's never "Citizen Kane," it's always some third-rate movie with some second-rate star. 
But the reason it's number one is because that's the week it came out. 
Because it's new, because it's fresh. 
People saw it and said "I didn't know that was there" and they noticed it. 
Two of the big success stories of the last 20 years in retail -- one sells things that are super-expensive in a blue box, and one sells things that are as cheap as they can make them. 
The only thing they have in common is that they're different. 
We're now in the fashion business, no matter what we do for a living, we're in the fashion business. 
And people in the fashion business know what it's like to be in the fashion business -- they're used to it. 
The rest of us have to figure out how to think that way. 
How to understand that it's not about interrupting people with big full-page ads, or insisting on meetings with people. 
But it's a totally different sort of process that determines which ideas spread, and which ones don't. 
They sold a billion dollars' worth of Aeron chairs by reinventing what it meant to sell a chair. 
They turned a chair from something the purchasing department bought, to something that was a status symbol about where you sat at work. 
This guy, Lionel Poilâne, the most famous baker in the world -- he died two and a half months ago, and he was a hero of mine and a dear friend. 
He lived in Paris. Last year, he sold 10 million dollars' worth of French bread. 
Every loaf baked in a bakery he owned, by one baker at a time, in a wood-fired oven. 
And when Lionel started his bakery, the French pooh-pooh-ed it. 
They didn't want to buy his bread. It didn't look like "French bread." 
It wasn't what they expected. 
It was neat; it was remarkable; and slowly, it spread from one person to another person until finally, it became the official bread of three-star restaurants in Paris. 
Now he's in London, and he ships by FedEx all around the world. 
What marketers used to do is make average products for average people. 
That's what mass marketing is. 
Smooth out the edges; go for the center; that's the big market. 
They would ignore the geeks, and God forbid, the laggards. 
It was all about going for the center. 
But in a world where the TV-industrial complex is broken, I don't think that's a strategy we want to use any more. 
I think the strategy we want to use is to not market to these people because they're really good at ignoring you. 
But market to these people because they care. 
These are the people who are obsessed with something. 
And when you talk to them, they'll listen, because they like listening -- it's about them. 
And if you're lucky, they'll tell their friends on the rest of the curve, and it'll spread. 
It'll spread to the entire curve. 
They have something I call "otaku" -- it's a great Japanese word. 
It describes the desire of someone who's obsessed to say, drive across Tokyo to try a new ramen noodle place, because that's what they do: they get obsessed with it. 
To make a product, to market an idea, to come up with any problem you want to solve that doesn't have a constituency with an otaku, is almost impossible. 
Instead, you have to find a group that really, desperately cares about what it is you have to say. 
Talk to them and make it easy for them to tell their friends. 
There's a hot sauce otaku, but there's no mustard otaku. 
That's why there's lots and lots of kinds of hot sauces, and not so many kinds of mustard. 
Not because it's hard to make interesting mustard -- you could make interesting mustard -- but people don't, because no one's obsessed with it, and thus no one tells their friends. 
Krispy Kreme has figured this whole thing out. 
It has a strategy, and what they do is, they enter a city, they talk to the people, with the otaku, and then they spread through the city to the people who've just crossed the street. 
This yoyo right here cost 112 dollars, but it sleeps for 12 minutes. 
Not everybody wants it but they don't care. 
They want to talk to the people who do, and maybe it'll spread. 
These guys make the loudest car stereo in the world. 
 It's as loud as a 747 jet. 
You can't get in, the car's got bulletproof glass, because it'll blow out the windshield otherwise. 
But the fact remains that when someone wants to put a couple of speakers in their car, if they've got the otaku or they've heard from someone who does, they go ahead and they pick this. 
It's really simple -- you sell to the people who are listening, and just maybe, those people tell their friends. 
So when Steve Jobs talks to 50,000 people at his keynote, who are all tuned in from 130 countries watching his two-hour commercial -- that's the only thing keeping his company in business -- it's that those 50,000 people care desperately enough to watch a two-hour commercial, and then tell their friends. 
Pearl Jam, 96 albums released in the last two years. 
Every one made a profit. How? 
They only sell them on their website. 
Those people who buy them have the otaku, and then they tell their friends, and it spreads and it spreads. 
This hospital crib cost 10,000 dollars, 10 times the standard. 
But hospitals are buying it faster than any other model. 
Hard Candy nail polish, doesn't appeal to everybody, but to the people who love it, they talk about it like crazy. 
This paint can right here saved the Dutch Boy paint company, making them a fortune. It costs 35 percent more than regular paint because Dutch Boy made a can that people talk about, because it's remarkable. 
They didn't just slap a new ad on the product; they changed what it meant to build a paint product. 
AmIhotornot.com -- everyday 250,000 people go to this site, run by two volunteers, and I can tell you they are hard graders --  They didn't get this way by advertising a lot. 
They got this way by being remarkable, sometimes a little too remarkable. 
And this picture frame has a cord going out the back, and you plug it into the wall. 
My father has this on his desk, and he sees his grandchildren everyday, changing constantly. 
And every single person who walks into his office hears the whole story of how this thing ended up on his desk. 
And one person at a time, the idea spreads. 
These are not diamonds, not really. 
They're made from "cremains." 
After you're cremated you can have yourself made into a gem. 
 Oh, you like my ring? It's my grandmother. 
 Fastest-growing business in the whole mortuary industry. 
But you don't have to be Ozzie Osborne -- you don't have to be super-outrageous to do this. 
What you have to do is figure out what people really want and give it to them. 
A couple of quick rules to wrap up. 
The first one is: Design is free when you get to scale. 
The people who come up with stuff that's remarkable more often than not figure out how to put design to work for them. 
Number two: The riskiest thing you can do now is be safe. 
Proctor and Gamble knows this, right? 
The whole model of being Proctor and Gamble is always about average products for average people. 
That's risky. The safe thing to do now is to be at the fringes, be remarkable. 
And being very good is one of the worst things you can possibly do. 
Very good is boring. Very good is average. 
It doesn't matter whether you're making a record album, or you're an architect, or you have a tract on sociology. 
If it's very good, it's not going to work, because no one's going to notice it. 
So my three stories. 
Silk put a product that does not need to be in the refrigerated section next to the milk in the refrigerated section. 
Sales tripled. Why? 
Milk, milk, milk, milk, milk -- not milk. 
For the people who were there and looking at that section, it was remarkable. 
They didn't triple their sales with advertising; they tripled it by doing something remarkable. 
That is a remarkable piece of art. You don't have to like it, but a 40-foot tall dog made out of bushes in the middle of New York City is remarkable.  Frank Gehry didn't just change a museum; he changed an entire city's economy by designing one building that people from all over the world went to see. 
Now, at countless meetings at, you know, the Portland City Council, or who knows where, they said, we need an architect -- can we get Frank Gehry? 
Because he did something that was at the fringes. 
And my big failure? I came out with an entire --  A record album and hopefully a whole bunch of record albums in SACD, this remarkable new format -- and I marketed it straight to people with 20,000-dollar stereos. 
People with 20,000-dollar stereos don't like new music. 
 So what you need to do is figure out who does care. 
Who is going to raise their hand and say, "I want to hear what you're doing next," and sell something to them. 
The last example I want to give you. 
This is a map of Soap Lake, Washington. 
As you can see, if that's nowhere, it's in the middle of it. 
 But they do have a lake. 
And people used to come from miles around to swim in the lake. 
They don't anymore. So the founding fathers said, "We've got some money to spend. 
What can we build here?" And like most committees, they were going to build something pretty safe. 
And then an artist came to them -- this is a true artist's rendering -- he wants to build a 55-foot tall lava lamp in the center of town. 
That's a purple cow; that's something worth noticing. 
I don't know about you, but if they build it, that's where I'm going to go. 
Thank you very much for your attention.

<title>Phil Borges: Photos of endangered cultures</title> 
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Photographer Phil Borges shows rarely seen images of people from the mountains of Dharamsala, India, and the jungles of the Ecuadorean Amazon. In documenting these endangered cultures, he intends to help preserve them.</description> 
A fact came out of MIT, couple of years ago. Ken Hale, who's a linguist, said that of the 6,000 languages spoken on Earth right now, 3,000 aren't spoken by the children. 
So that in one generation, we're going to halve our cultural diversity. 
He went on to say that every two weeks, an elder goes to the grave carrying the last spoken word of that culture. 
So an entire philosophy, a body of knowledge about the natural world that had been empirically gleaned over centuries, goes away. 
And this happens every two weeks. 
So for the last 20 years, since my dental experience, I have been traveling the world and coming back with stories about some of these people. 
What I'd like to do right now is share some of those stories with you. 
This is Tamdin. 
She is a 69-year-old nun. 
She was thrown in prison in Tibet for two years for putting up a little tiny placard protesting the occupation of her country. 
And when I met her, she had just taken a walk over the Himalayas from Lhasa, the capital of Tibet, into Nepal, across to India -- 30 days -- to meet her leader, the Dalai Lama. 
The Dalai Lama lives in Dharamsala, India. 
So I took this picture three days after she arrived, and she had this beat-up pair of tennis shoes on, with her toes sticking out. 
And she crossed in March, and there's a lot of snow at 18,500 feet in March. 
This is Paldin. 
Paldin is a 62-year-old monk. 
And he spent 33 years in prison. 
His whole monastery was thrown into prison at the time of the uprising, when the Dalai Lama had to leave Tibet. 
And he was beaten, starved, tortured -- lost all his teeth while in prison. 
And when I met him, he was a kind gentle old man. 
And it really impressed me -- I met him two weeks after he got out of prison -- that he went through that experience, and ended up with the demeanor that he had. 
So I was in Dharamsala meeting these people, and I'd spent about five weeks there, and I was hearing these similar stories of these refugees that had poured out of Tibet into Dharamsala. 
And it just so happened, on the fifth week, there was a public teaching by the Dalai Lama. 
And I was watching this crowd of monks and nuns, many of which I had just interviewed, and heard their stories, and I watched their faces, and they gave us a little FM radio, and we could listen to the translation of his teachings. 
And what he said was: treat your enemies as if they were precious jewels, because it's your enemies that build your tolerance and patience on the road to your enlightenment. 
That hit me so hard, telling these people that had been through this experience. 
So, two months later, I went into Tibet, and I started interviewing the people there, taking my photographs. That's what I do. 
I interview and do portraits. 
And this is a little girl. 
I took her portrait up on top of the Jokhang Temple. 
And I'd snuck in -- because it's totally illegal to have a picture of the Dalai Lama in Tibet -- it's the quickest way you can get arrested. 
So I snuck in a bunch of little wallet-sized pictures of the Dalai Lama, and I would hand them out. 
And when I gave them to the people, they'd either hold them to their heart, or they'd hold them up to their head and just stay there. 
And this is -- well, at the time -- I did this 10 years ago -- that was 36 years after the Dalai Lama had left. 
So I was going in, interviewing these people and doing their portraits. 
This is Jigme and her sister, Sonam. 
And they live up on the Chang Tang, the Tibetan Plateau, way in the western part of the country. 
This is at 17,000 feet. 
And they had just come down from the high pastures, at 18,000 feet. 
Same thing: gave her a picture, she held it up to her forehead. 
And I usually hand out Polaroids when I do these, because I'm setting up lights, and checking my lights, and when I showed her her Polaroid, she screamed and ran into her tent. 
This is Tenzin Gyatso; he was found to be the Buddha of Compassion at the age of two, out in a peasant's house, way out in the middle of nowhere. 
At the age of four, he was installed as the 14th Dalai Lama. 
As a teenager, he faced the invasion of his country, and had to deal with it -- he was the leader of the country. 
Eight years later, when they discovered there was a plot to kill him, they dressed him up like a beggar and snuck him out of the country on horseback, and took the same trip that Tamdin did. 
And he's never been back to his country since. 
And if you think about this man, 46 years later, still sticking to this non-violent response to a severe political and human rights issue. 
And the young people, young Tibetans, are starting to say, listen, this doesn't work. 
You know, violence as a political tool is all the rage right now. 
And he still is holding this line. 
So this is our icon to non-violence in our world -- one of our living icons. 
This is another leader of his people. 
This is Moi. This is in the Ecuadorian Amazon. 
And Moi is 35 years old. 
And this area of the Ecuadorian Amazon -- oil was discovered in 1972. 
And in this period of time -- since that time -- as much oil, or twice as much oil as was spilled in the Exxon Valdez accident, was spilled in this little area of the Amazon, and the tribes in this area have constantly had to move. 
And Moi belongs to the Huaorani tribe, and they're known as very fierce, they're known as "auca." 
And they've managed to keep out the seismologists and the oil workers with spears and blowguns. 
And we spent -- I was with a team -- two weeks with these guys out in the jungle watching them hunt. 
This was on a monkey hunt, hunting with curare-tipped darts. 
And the knowledge that these people have about the natural environment is incredible. 
They could hear things, smell things, see things I couldn't see. 
And I couldn't even see the monkeys that they were getting with these darts. 
This is Yadira, and Yadira is five years old. She's in a tribe that's neighboring the Huaorani. 
And her tribe has had to move three times in the last 10 years because of the oil spills. 
And we never hear about that. And the latest infraction against these people is, as part of Plan Colombia, we're spraying Paraquat or Round Up, whatever it is -- we're defoliating thousands of acres of the Ecuadorian Amazon in our war on drugs. 
And these people are the people who take the brunt of it. 
This is Mengatoue. 
He's the shaman of the Huaorani, and he said to us, you know, I'm an older man now; I'm getting tired, you know; I'm tired of spearing these oil workers. 
I wish they would just go away. 
And I was -- I usually travel alone when I do my work, but I did this -- I hosted a program for Discovery, and when I went down with the team, I was quite concerned about going in with a whole bunch of people, especially into the Huaorani, deep into the Huaorani tribe. 
And as it turned out, these guys really taught me a thing or two about blending in with the locals. 
 One of the things I did just before 9/11 -- August of 2001 -- I took my son, Dax, who was 16 at the time, and I took him to Pakistan. 
Because at first I wanted -- you know, I've taken him on a couple of trips, but I wanted him to see people that live on a dollar a day or less. 
I wanted him to get an experience in the Islamic world and I also wanted him to -- I was going there to work with a group, do a story on a group called the Kalash, that are a group of animists, 3,000 animists, that live -- very small area -- surrounded by Islam -- there's 3,000 of these Kalash left; they're incredible people. 
So it was a great experience for him. He stayed up all night with them, drumming and dancing. 
And he brought a soccer ball, and we had soccer every night in this little village. 
And then we went up and met their shaman. 
By the way, Mengatoue was the shaman of his tribe as well. 
And this is John Doolikahn, who's the shaman of the Kalash. 
And he's up in the mountains, right on the border with Afghanistan. 
In fact, on that other side is the area, Tora Bora, the area where Osama bin Laden's supposed to be. This is the tribal area. 
And we watched and stayed with John Doolikahn. 
And the shaman -- I did a whole series on shamanism, which is an interesting phenomenon. 
But around the world, they go into trance in different ways, and in Pakistan, the way they do it is they burn juniper leaves and they sacrifice an animal, pour the blood of the animal on the leaves and then inhale the smoke. 
And they're all praying to the mountain gods as they go into trance. 
You know, getting kids used to different realities, I think, is so important. What Dan Dennett said the other day -- having a curriculum where they study different religions, just to make a mental flexibility, give them a mental flexibility in different belief systems -- I think this is so necessary in our world today as you see these clash of beliefs taking place. 
And all the security issues they cause us. 
So, one thing we did five years ago: we started a program that links kids in indigenous communities with kids in the United States. 
So we first hooked up a spot in the Navajo Nation with a classroom in Seattle. 
We now have 15 sites. 
We have one in Kathmandu, Nepal; Dharamsala, India; Takaungu, Kenya -- Takaungu is one-third Christian, one-third Muslim and one-third animist, the community is -- Ollantaytambo, Peru, and Arctic Village, Alaska. 
This is Daniel; he's one of our students in Arctic Village, Alaska. 
He lives in this log cabin -- no running water, no heat other than -- no windows and high-speed Internet connection. 
And this is -- I see this rolling out all over -- this is our site in Ollantaytambo, Peru, four years ago, where they first saw their first computers; now they have computers in their classrooms. 
And the way we've done this -- we teach digital storytelling to these kids. 
And we have them tell stories about issues in their community in their community that they care about. 
And this is in Peru, where the kids told the story about a river that they cleaned up. 
And the way we do it is, we do it in workshops, and we bring people who want to learn digital workflow and storytelling, and have them work with the kids. 
And just this last year we've taken a group of teenagers in, and this has worked the best. 
So our dream is to bring teenagers together, so they'll have a community service experience as well as a cross-cultural experience, as they teach kids in these areas and help them build their communication infrastructure. 
This is teaching Photoshop in the Tibetan children's village in Dharamsala. 
We have the website, where the kids all get their homepage. 
This is all their movies. We've got about 60 movies that these kids have made, and they're quite incredible. 
The one I want to show you -- after we get them to make the movies, we have a night where we show the movies to the community. 
And this is in Takaungu -- we've got a generator and a digital projector, and we're projecting it up against a barn, and showing one of the movies that they made. 
And if you get a chance, you can go to our website, and you'll see the incredible work these kids do. 
The other thing: I wanted to give indigenous people a voice. 
That was one of the big motivating factors. 
But the other motivating factor is the insular nature of our country. 
National Geographic just did a Roper Study of 18 to 26 year olds in our country and in nine other industrialized countries. 
It was a two million dollar study. 
United States came in second to last in geographic knowledge. 
70 percent of the kids couldn't find Afghanistan or Iraq on a map; 60 percent couldn't find India; 30 percent couldn't find the Pacific Ocean. 
And this is a study that was just done a couple of years ago. 
So what I'd like to show you now, in the couple of minutes I have left, is a film that a student made in Guatemala. 
We just had a workshop in Guatemala. 
A week before we got to the workshop, a massive landslide, caused by Hurricane Stan, last October, came in and buried 600 people alive in their village. 
And this kid lived in the village -- he wasn't there at the time -- and this is the little movie he put together about that. 
And he hadn't seen a computer before we did this movie. We taught him Photoshop and -- yeah, we can play it. 
This is an old Mayan funeral chant that he got from his grandfather. 
Thank you very much.

<title>James Watson: How we discovered DNA</title> 
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Nobel laureate James Watson opens TED2005 with the frank and funny story of how he and his research partner, Francis Crick, discovered the structure of DNA.</description> 
Well, I thought there would be a podium, so I'm a bit scared. 
 Chris asked me to tell again how we found the structure of DNA. 
And since, you know, I follow his orders, I'll do it. 
But it slightly bores me. 
 And, you know, I wrote a book. So I'll say something --  -- I'll say a little about, you know, how the discovery was made, and why Francis and I found it. 
And then, I hope maybe I have at least five minutes to say what makes me tick now. 
In back of me is a picture of me when I was 17. 
I was at the University of Chicago, in my third year, and I was in my third year because the University of Chicago let you in after two years of high school. 
So you -- it was fun to get away from high school --  -- because I was very small, and I was no good in sports, or anything like that. 
But I should say that my background -- my father was, you know, raised to be an Episcopalian and Republican, but after one year of college, he became an atheist and a Democrat. 
 And my mother was Irish Catholic, and -- but she didn't take religion too seriously. 
And by the age of 11, I was no longer going to Sunday Mass, and going on birdwatching walks with my father. 
So early on, I heard of Charles Darwin. 
I guess, you know, he was the big hero. 
And, you know, you understand life as it now exists through evolution. 
And at the University of Chicago I was a zoology major, and thought I would end up, you know, if I was bright enough, maybe getting a Ph.D. from Cornell in ornithology. 
Then, in the Chicago paper, there was a review of a book called "What is Life?" by the great physicist, Schrodinger. 
And that, of course, had been a question I wanted to know. 
You know, Darwin explained life after it got started, but what was the essence of life? 
And Schrodinger said the essence was information present in our chromosomes, and it had to be present on a molecule. I'd never really thought of molecules before. 
You know chromosomes, but this was a molecule, and somehow all the information was probably present in some digital form. And there was the big question of, how did you copy the information? 
So that was the book. And so, from that moment on, I wanted to be a geneticist -- understand the gene and, through that, understand life. 
So I had, you know, a hero at a distance. 
It wasn't a baseball player; it was Linus Pauling. 
And so I applied to Caltech and they turned me down. 
 So I went to Indiana, which was actually as good as Caltech in genetics, and besides, they had a really good basketball team.  So I had a really quite happy life at Indiana. 
And it was at Indiana I got the impression that, you know, the gene was likely to be DNA. 
And so when I got my Ph.D., I should go and search for DNA. 
So I first went to Copenhagen because I thought, well, maybe I could become a biochemist, but I discovered biochemistry was very boring. 
It wasn't going anywhere toward, you know, saying what the gene was; it was just nuclear science. And oh, that's the book, little book. 
You can read it in about two hours. 
And -- but then I went to a meeting in Italy. 
And there was an unexpected speaker who wasn't on the program, and he talked about DNA. 
And this was Maurice Wilkins. He was trained as a physicist, and after the war he wanted to do biophysics, and he picked DNA because DNA had been determined at the Rockefeller Institute to possibly be the genetic molecules on the chromosomes. 
Most people believed it was proteins. 
But Wilkins, you know, thought DNA was the best bet, and he showed this x-ray photograph. 
Sort of crystalline. So DNA had a structure, even though it owed it to probably different molecules carrying different sets of instructions. 
So there was something universal about the DNA molecule. 
So I wanted to work with him, but he didn't want a former birdwatcher, and I ended up in Cambridge, England. 
So I went to Cambridge, because it was really the best place in the world then for x-ray crystallography. And x-ray crystallography is now a subject in, you know, chemistry departments. 
I mean, in those days it was the domain of the physicists. 
So the best place for x-ray crystallography was at the Cavendish Laboratory at Cambridge. 
And there I met Francis Crick. 
I went there without knowing him. He was 35. I was 23. 
And within a day, we had decided that maybe we could take a shortcut to finding the structure of DNA. 
Not solve it like, you know, in rigorous fashion, but build a model, an electro-model, using some coordinates of, you know, length, all that sort of stuff from x-ray photographs. 
But just ask what the molecule -- how should it fold up? 
And the reason for doing so, at the center of this photograph, is Linus Pauling. About six months before, he proposed the alpha helical structure for proteins. And in doing so, he banished the man out on the right, Sir Lawrence Bragg, who was the Cavendish professor. 
This is a photograph several years later, when Bragg had cause to smile. 
He certainly wasn't smiling when I got there, because he was somewhat humiliated by Pauling getting the alpha helix, and the Cambridge people failing because they weren't chemists. 
And certainly, neither Crick or I were chemists, so we tried to build a model. And he knew, Francis knew Wilkins. 
So Wilkins said he thought it was the helix. 
X-ray diagram, he thought was comparable with the helix. 
So we built a three-stranded model. 
The people from London came up. 
Wilkins and this collaborator, or possible collaborator, Rosalind Franklin, came up and sort of laughed at our model. 
They said it was lousy, and it was. 
So we were told to build no more models; we were incompetent. 
 And so we didn't build any models, and Francis sort of continued to work on proteins. 
And basically, I did nothing. And -- except read. 
You know, basically, reading is a good thing; you get facts. 
And we kept telling the people in London that Linus Pauling's going to move on to DNA. 
If DNA is that important, Linus will know it. 
He'll build a model, and then we're going to be scooped. 
And, in fact, he'd written the people in London: Could he see their x-ray photograph? 
And they had the wisdom to say "no." So he didn't have it. 
But there was ones in the literature. 
Actually, Linus didn't look at them that carefully. 
But about, oh, 15 months after I got to Cambridge, a rumor began to appear from Linus Pauling's son, who was in Cambridge, that his father was now working on DNA. 
And so, one day Peter came in and he said he was Peter Pauling, and he gave me a copy of his father's manuscripts. 
And boy, I was scared because I thought, you know, we may be scooped. 
I have nothing to do, no qualifications for anything. 
 And so there was the paper, and he proposed a three-stranded structure. 
And I read it, and it was just -- it was crap. 
 So this was, you know, unexpected from the world's --  -- and so, it was held together by hydrogen bonds between phosphate groups. 
Well, if the peak pH that cells have is around seven, those hydrogen bonds couldn't exist. 
We rushed over to the chemistry department and said, "Could Pauling be right?" And Alex Hust said, "No." So we were happy. 
 And, you know, we were still in the game, but we were frightened that somebody at Caltech would tell Linus that he was wrong. 
And so Bragg said, "Build models." 
And a month after we got the Pauling manuscript -- I should say I took the manuscript to London, and showed the people. 
Well, I said, Linus was wrong and that we're still in the game and that they should immediately start building models. 
But Wilkins said "no." Rosalind Franklin was leaving in about two months, and after she left he would start building models. 
And so I came back with that news to Cambridge, and Bragg said, "Build models." 
Well, of course, I wanted to build models. 
And there's a picture of Rosalind. She really, you know, in one sense she was a chemist, but really she would have been trained -- she didn't know any organic chemistry or quantum chemistry. 
She was a crystallographer. 
And I think part of the reason she didn't want to build models was, she wasn't a chemist, whereas Pauling was a chemist. 
And so Crick and I, you know, started building models, and I'd learned a little chemistry, but not enough. 
Well, we got the answer on the 28th February '53. 
And it was because of a rule, which, to me, is a very good rule: Never be the brightest person in a room, and we weren't. 
We weren't the best chemists in the room. 
I went in and showed them a pairing I'd done, and Jerry Donohue -- he was a chemist -- he said, it's wrong. 
You've got -- the hydrogen atoms are in the wrong place. 
I just put them down like they were in the books. 
He said they were wrong. 
So the next day, you know, after I thought, "Well, he might be right." 
So I changed the locations, and then we found the base pairing, and Francis immediately said the chains run in absolute directions. 
And we knew we were right. 
So it was a pretty, you know, it all happened in about two hours. 
From nothing to thing. 
And we knew it was big because, you know, if you just put A next to T and G next to C, you have a copying mechanism. 
So we saw how genetic information is carried. 
It's the order of the four bases. 
So in a sense, it is a sort of digital-type information. 
And you copy it by going from strand-separating. 
So, you know, if it didn't work this way, you might as well believe it, because you didn't have any other scheme. 
 But that's not the way most scientists think. 
Most scientists are really rather dull. 
They said, we won't think about it until we know it's right. 
But, you know, we thought, well, it's at least 95 percent right or 99 percent right. 
So think about it. The next five years, there were essentially something like five references to our work in "Nature" -- none. 
And so we were left by ourselves, and trying to do the last part of the trio: how do you -- what does this genetic information do? 
It was pretty obvious that it provided the information to an RNA molecule, and then how do you go from RNA to protein? 
For about three years we just -- I tried to solve the structure of RNA. 
It didn't yield. It didn't give good x-ray photographs. 
I was decidedly unhappy; a girl didn't marry me. 
It was really, you know, sort of a shitty time. 
 So there's a picture of Francis and I before I met the girl, so I'm still looking happy. 
 But there is what we did when we didn't know where to go forward: we formed a club and called it the RNA Tie Club. 
George Gamow, also a great physicist, he designed the tie. 
He was one of the members. The question was: How do you go from a four-letter code to the 20-letter code of proteins? 
Feynman was a member, and Teller, and friends of Gamow. 
But that's the only -- no, we were only photographed twice. 
And on both occasions, you know, one of us was missing the tie. 
There's Francis up on the upper right, and Alex Rich -- the M.D.-turned-crystallographer -- is next to me. 
This was taken in Cambridge in September of 1955. 
And I'm smiling, sort of forced, I think, because the girl I had, boy, she was gone. 
 And so I didn't really get happy until 1960, because then we found out, basically, you know, that there are three forms of RNA. 
And we knew, basically, DNA provides the information for RNA. 
RNA provides the information for protein. 
And that let Marshall Nirenberg, you know, take RNA -- synthetic RNA -- put it in a system making protein. He made polyphenylalanine, polyphenylalanine. So that's the first cracking of the genetic code, and it was all over by 1966. 
So there, that's what Chris wanted me to do, it was -- so what happened since then? 
Well, at that time -- I should go back. 
When we found the structure of DNA, I gave my first talk at Cold Spring Harbor. The physicist, Leo Szilard, he looked at me and said, "Are you going to patent this?" 
And -- but he knew patent law, and that we couldn't patent it, because you couldn't. No use for it. 
 And so DNA didn't become a useful molecule, and the lawyers didn't enter into the equation until 1973, 20 years later, when Boyer and Cohen in San Francisco and Stanford came up with their method of recombinant DNA, and Stanford patented it and made a lot of money. 
At least they patented something which, you know, could do useful things. 
And then, they learned how to read the letters for the code. 
And, boom, we've, you know, had a biotech industry. And, but we were still a long ways from, you know, answering a question which sort of dominated my childhood, which is: How do you nature-nurture? 
And so I'll go on. I'm already out of time, but this is Michael Wigler, a very, very clever mathematician turned physicist. And he developed a technique which essentially will let us look at sample DNA and, eventually, a million spots along it. 
There's a chip there, a conventional one. Then there's one made by a photolithography by a company in Madison called NimbleGen, which is way ahead of Affymetrix. 
And we use their technique. 
And what you can do is sort of compare DNA of normal segs versus cancer. 
And you can see on the top that cancers which are bad show insertions or deletions. 
So the DNA is really badly mucked up, whereas if you have a chance of surviving, the DNA isn't so mucked up. 
So we think that this will eventually lead to what we call "DNA biopsies." Before you get treated for cancer, you should really look at this technique, and get a feeling of the face of the enemy. 
It's not a -- it's only a partial look, but it's a -- I think it's going to be very, very useful. 
So, we started with breast cancer because there's lots of money for it, no government money. 
And now I have a sort of vested interest: I want to do it for prostate cancer. So, you know, you aren't treated if it's not dangerous. 
But Wigler, besides looking at cancer cells, looked at normal cells, and made a really sort of surprising observation. 
Which is, all of us have about 10 places in our genome where we've lost a gene or gained another one. 
So we're sort of all imperfect. And the question is well, if we're around here, you know, these little losses or gains might not be too bad. 
But if these deletions or amplifications occurred in the wrong gene, maybe we'll feel sick. 
So the first disease he looked at is autism. 
And the reason we looked at autism is we had the money to do it. 
Looking at an individual is about 3,000 dollars. And the parent of a child with Asperger's disease, the high-intelligence autism, had sent his thing to a conventional company; they didn't do it. 
Couldn't do it by conventional genetics, but just scanning it we began to find genes for autism. 
And you can see here, there are a lot of them. 
So a lot of autistic kids are autistic because they just lost a big piece of DNA. 
I mean, big piece at the molecular level. 
We saw one autistic kid, about five million bases just missing from one of his chromosomes. 
We haven't yet looked at the parents, but the parents probably don't have that loss, or they wouldn't be parents. 
Now, so, our autism study is just beginning. We got three million dollars. 
I think it will cost at least 10 to 20 before you'd be in a position to help parents who've had an autistic child, or think they may have an autistic child, and can we spot the difference? 
So this same technique should probably look at all. 
It's a wonderful way to find genes. 
And so, I'll conclude by saying we've looked at 20 people with schizophrenia. 
And we thought we'd probably have to look at several hundred before we got the picture. But as you can see, there's seven out of 20 had a change which was very high. 
And yet, in the controls there were three. 
So what's the meaning of the controls? 
Were they crazy also, and we didn't know it? 
Or, you know, were they normal? I would guess they're normal. 
And what we think in schizophrenia is there are genes of predisposure, and whether this is one that predisposes -- and then there's only a sub-segment of the population that's capable of being schizophrenic. 
Now, we don't have really any evidence of it, but I think, to give you a hypothesis, the best guess is that if you're left-handed, you're prone to schizophrenia. 
30 percent of schizophrenic people are left-handed, and schizophrenia has a very funny genetics, which means 60 percent of the people are genetically left-handed, but only half of it showed. I don't have the time to say. 
Now, some people who think they're right-handed are genetically left-handed. OK. I'm just saying that, if you think, oh, I don't carry a left-handed gene so therefore my, you know, children won't be at risk of schizophrenia. You might. OK? 
 So it's, to me, an extraordinarily exciting time. 
We ought to be able to find the gene for bipolar; there's a relationship. 
And if I had enough money, we'd find them all this year. 
I thank you.

<title>Aubrey de Grey: A roadmap to end aging</title> 
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Cambridge researcher Aubrey de Grey argues that aging is merely a disease -- and a curable one at that. Humans age in seven basic ways, he says, all of which can be averted.</description> 
18 minutes is an absolutely brutal time limit, so I'm going to dive straight in, right at the point where I get this thing to work. 
Here we go. I'm going to talk about five different things. 
I'm going to talk about why defeating aging is desirable. 
I'm going to talk about why we have to get our shit together, and actually talk about this a bit more than we do. 
I'm going to talk about feasibility as well, of course. 
I'm going to talk about why we are so fatalistic about doing anything about aging. 
And then I'm going spend perhaps the second half of the talk talking about, you know, how we might actually be able to prove that fatalism is wrong, namely, by actually doing something about it. 
I'm going to do that in two steps. 
The first one I'm going to talk about is how to get from a relatively modest amount of life extension -- which I'm going to define as 30 years, applied to people who are already in middle-age when you start -- to a point which can genuinely be called defeating aging. 
Namely, essentially an elimination of the relationship between how old you are and how likely you are to die in the next year -- or indeed, to get sick in the first place. 
And of course, the last thing I'm going to talk about is how to reach that intermediate step, that point of maybe 30 years life extension. 
So I'm going to start with why we should. 
Now, I want to ask a question. 
Hands up: anyone in the audience who is in favor of malaria? 
That was easy. OK. 
OK. Hands up: anyone in the audience who's not sure whether malaria is a good thing or a bad thing? 
OK. So we all think malaria is a bad thing. 
That's very good news, because I thought that was what the answer would be. 
Now the thing is, I would like to put it to you that the main reason why we think that malaria is a bad thing is because of a characteristic of malaria that it shares with aging. 
And here is that characteristic. 
The only real difference is that aging kills considerably more people than malaria does. 
Now, I like in an audience, in Britain especially, to talk about the comparison with foxhunting, which is something that was banned after a long struggle, by the government not very many months ago. 
I mean, I know I'm with a sympathetic audience here, but, as we know, a lot of people are not entirely persuaded by this logic. 
And this is actually a rather good comparison, it seems to me. 
You know, a lot of people said, "Well, you know, city boys have no business telling us rural types what to do with our time. 
It's a traditional part of the way of life, and we should be allowed to carry on doing it. 
It's ecologically sound; it stops the population explosion of foxes." 
But ultimately, the government prevailed in the end, because the majority of the British public, and certainly the majority of members of Parliament, came to the conclusion that it was really something that should not be tolerated in a civilized society. 
And I think that human aging shares all of these characteristics in spades. 
What part of this do people not understand? 
It's not just about life, of course --  -- it's about healthy life, you know -- getting frail and miserable and dependent is no fun, whether or not dying may be fun. 
So really, this is how I would like to describe it. 
It's a global trance. 
These are the sorts of unbelievable excuses that people give for aging. 
And, I mean, OK, I'm not actually saying that these excuses are completely valueless. 
There are some good points to be made here, things that we ought to be thinking about, forward planning so that nothing goes too -- well, so that we minimize the turbulence when we actually figure out how to fix aging. 
But these are completely crazy, when you actually remember your sense of proportion. 
You know, these are arguments; these are things that would be legitimate to be concerned about. 
But the question is, are they so dangerous -- these risks of doing something about aging -- that they outweigh the downside of doing the opposite, namely, leaving aging as it is? 
Are these so bad that they outweigh condemning 100,000 people a day to an unnecessarily early death? 
You know, if you haven't got an argument that's that strong, then just don't waste my time, is what I say. 
 Now, there is one argument that some people do think really is that strong, and here it is. 
People worry about overpopulation; they say, "Well, if we fix aging, no one's going to die to speak of, or at least the death toll is going to be much lower, only from crossing St. Giles carelessly. 
And therefore, we're not going to be able to have many kids, and kids are really important to most people." 
And that's true. 
And you know, a lot of people try to fudge this question, and give answers like this. 
I don't agree with those answers. I think they basically don't work. 
I think it's true, that we will face a dilemma in this respect. 
We will have to decide whether to have a low birth rate, or a high death rate. 
A high death rate will, of course, arise from simply rejecting these therapies, in favor of carrying on having a lot of kids. 
And, I say that that's fine -- the future of humanity is entitled to make that choice. 
What's not fine is for us to make that choice on behalf of the future. 
If we vacillate, hesitate, and do not actually develop these therapies, then we are condemning a whole cohort of people -- who would have been young enough and healthy enough to benefit from those therapies, but will not be, because we haven't developed them as quickly as we could -- we'll be denying those people an indefinite life span, and I consider that that is immoral. 
That's my answer to the overpopulation question. 
Right. So the next thing is, now why should we get a little bit more active on this? 
And the fundamental answer is that the pro-aging trance is not as dumb as it looks. 
It's actually a sensible way of coping with the inevitability of aging. 
Aging is ghastly, but it's inevitable, so, you know, we've got to find some way to put it out of our minds, and it's rational to do anything that we might want to do, to do that. 
Like, for example, making up these ridiculous reasons why aging is actually a good thing after all. 
But of course, that only works when we have both of these components. 
And as soon as the inevitability bit becomes a little bit unclear -- and we might be in range of doing something about aging -- this becomes part of the problem. 
This pro-aging trance is what stops us from agitating about these things. 
And that's why we have to really talk about this a lot -- evangelize, I will go so far as to say, quite a lot -- in order to get people's attention, and make people realize that they are in a trance in this regard. 
So that's all I'm going to say about that. 
I'm now going to talk about feasibility. 
And the fundamental reason, I think, why we feel that aging is inevitable is summed up in a definition of aging that I'm giving here. 
A very simple definition. 
Aging is a side effect of being alive in the first place, which is to say, metabolism. 
This is not a completely tautological statement; it's a reasonable statement. 
Aging is basically a process that happens to inanimate objects like cars, and it also happens to us, despite the fact that we have a lot of clever self-repair mechanisms, because those self-repair mechanisms are not perfect. 
So basically, metabolism, which is defined as basically everything that keeps us alive from one day to the next, has side effects. 
Those side effects accumulate and eventually cause pathology. 
That's a fine definition. So we can put it this way: we can say that, you know, we have this chain of events. 
And there are really two games in town, according to most people, with regard to postponing aging. 
They're what I'm calling here the "gerontology approach" and the "geriatrics approach." 
The geriatrician will intervene late in the day, when pathology is becoming evident, and the geriatrician will try and hold back the sands of time, and stop the accumulation of side effects from causing the pathology quite so soon. 
Of course, it's a very short-term-ist strategy; it's a losing battle, because the things that are causing the pathology are becoming more abundant as time goes on. 
The gerontology approach looks much more promising on the surface, because, you know, prevention is better than cure. 
But unfortunately the thing is that we don't understand metabolism very well. 
In fact, we have a pitifully poor understanding of how organisms work -- even cells we're not really too good on yet. 
We've discovered things like, for example, RNA interference only a few years ago, and this is a really fundamental component of how cells work. 
Basically, gerontology is a fine approach in the end, but it is not an approach whose time has come when we're talking about intervention. 
So then, what do we do about that? 
I mean, that's a fine logic, that sounds pretty convincing, pretty ironclad, doesn't it? 
But it isn't. 
Before I tell you why it isn't, I'm going to go a little bit into what I'm calling step two. 
Just suppose, as I said, that we do acquire -- let's say we do it today for the sake of argument -- the ability to confer 30 extra years of healthy life on people who are already in middle age, let's say 55. 
I'm going to call that "robust human rejuvenation." OK. 
What would that actually mean for how long people of various ages today -- or equivalently, of various ages at the time that these therapies arrive -- would actually live? 
In order to answer that question -- you might think it's simple, but it's not simple. 
We can't just say, "Well, if they're young enough to benefit from these therapies, then they'll live 30 years longer." 
That's the wrong answer. 
And the reason it's the wrong answer is because of progress. 
There are two sorts of technological progress really, for this purpose. 
There are fundamental, major breakthroughs, and there are incremental refinements of those breakthroughs. 
Now, they differ a great deal in terms of the predictability of time frames. 
Fundamental breakthroughs: very hard to predict how long it's going to take to make a fundamental breakthrough. 
It was a very long time ago that we decided that flying would be fun, and it took us until 1903 to actually work out how to do it. 
But after that, things were pretty steady and pretty uniform. 
I think this is a reasonable sequence of events that happened in the progression of the technology of powered flight. 
We can think, really, that each one is sort of beyond the imagination of the inventor of the previous one, if you like. 
The incremental advances have added up to something which is not incremental anymore. 
This is the sort of thing you see after a fundamental breakthrough. 
And you see it in all sorts of technologies. 
Computers: you can look at a more or less parallel time line, happening of course a bit later. 
You can look at medical care. I mean, hygiene, vaccines, antibiotics -- you know, the same sort of time frame. 
So I think that actually step two, that I called a step a moment ago, isn't a step at all. 
That in fact, the people who are young enough to benefit from these first therapies that give this moderate amount of life extension, even though those people are already middle-aged when the therapies arrive, will be at some sort of cusp. 
They will mostly survive long enough to receive improved treatments that will give them a further 30 or maybe 50 years. 
In other words, they will be staying ahead of the game. 
The therapies will be improving faster than the remaining imperfections in the therapies are catching up with us. 
This is a very important point for me to get across. 
Because, you know, most people, when they hear that I predict that a lot of people alive today are going to live to 1,000 or more, they think that I'm saying that we're going to invent therapies in the next few decades that are so thoroughly eliminating aging that those therapies will let us live to 1,000 or more. 
I'm not saying that at all. 
I'm saying that the rate of improvement of those therapies will be enough. 
They'll never be perfect, but we'll be able to fix the things that 200-year-olds die of, before we have any 200-year-olds. 
And the same for 300 and 400 and so on. 
I decided to give this a little name, which is "longevity escape velocity." 
 Well, it seems to get the point across. 
So, these trajectories here are basically how we would expect people to live, in terms of remaining life expectancy, as measured by their health, for given ages that they were at the time that these therapies arrive. 
If you're already 100, or even if you're 80 -- and an average 80-year-old, we probably can't do a lot for you with these therapies, because you're too close to death's door for the really initial, experimental therapies to be good enough for you. 
You won't be able to withstand them. 
But if you're only 50, then there's a chance that you might be able to pull out of the dive and, you know --  -- eventually get through this and start becoming biologically younger in a meaningful sense, in terms of your youthfulness, both physical and mental, and in terms of your risk of death from age-related causes. 
And of course, if you're a bit younger than that, then you're never really even going to get near to being fragile enough to die of age-related causes. 
So this is a genuine conclusion that I come to, that the first 150-year-old -- we don't know how old that person is today, because we don't know how long it's going to take to get these first-generation therapies. 
But irrespective of that age, I'm claiming that the first person to live to 1,000 -- subject of course, to, you know, global catastrophes -- is actually, probably, only about 10 years younger than the first 150-year-old. 
And that's quite a thought. 
Alright, so finally I'm going to spend the rest of the talk, my last seven-and-a-half minutes, on step one; namely, how do we actually get to this moderate amount of life extension that will allow us to get to escape velocity? 
And in order to do that, I need to talk about mice a little bit. 
I have a corresponding milestone to robust human rejuvenation. 
I'm calling it "robust mouse rejuvenation," not very imaginatively. 
And this is what it is. 
I say we're going to take a long-lived strain of mouse, which basically means mice that live about three years on average. 
We do exactly nothing to them until they're already two years old. 
And then we do a whole bunch of stuff to them, and with those therapies, we get them to live, on average, to their fifth birthday. 
So, in other words, we add two years -- we treble their remaining lifespan, starting from the point that we started the therapies. 
The question then is, what would that actually mean for the time frame until we get to the milestone I talked about earlier for humans? 
Which we can now, as I've explained, equivalently call either robust human rejuvenation or longevity escape velocity. 
Secondly, what does it mean for the public's perception of how long it's going to take for us to get to those things, starting from the time we get the mice? 
And thirdly, the question is, what will it do to actually how much people want it? 
And it seems to me that the first question is entirely a biology question, and it's extremely hard to answer. 
One has to be very speculative, and many of my colleagues would say that we should not do this speculation, that we should simply keep our counsel until we know more. 
I say that's nonsense. 
I say we absolutely are irresponsible if we stay silent on this. 
We need to give our best guess as to the time frame, in order to give people a sense of proportion so that they can assess their priorities. 
So, I say that we have a 50/50 chance of reaching this RHR milestone, robust human rejuvenation, within 15 years from the point that we get to robust mouse rejuvenation. 
15 years from the robust mouse. 
The public's perception will probably be somewhat better than that. 
The public tends to underestimate how difficult scientific things are. 
So they'll probably think it's five years away. 
They'll be wrong, but that actually won't matter too much. 
And finally, of course, I think it's fair to say that a large part of the reason why the public is so ambivalent about aging now is the global trance I spoke about earlier, the coping strategy. 
That will be history at this point, because it will no longer be possible to believe that aging is inevitable in humans, since it's been postponed so very effectively in mice. 
So we're likely to end up with a very strong change in people's attitudes, and of course that has enormous implications. 
So in order to tell you now how we're going to get these mice, I'm going to add a little bit to my description of aging. 
I'm going to use this word "damage" to denote these intermediate things that are caused by metabolism and that eventually cause pathology. 
Because the critical thing about this is that even though the damage only eventually causes pathology, the damage itself is caused ongoing-ly throughout life, starting before we're born. 
But it is not part of metabolism itself. 
And this turns out to be useful. 
Because we can re-draw our original diagram this way. 
We can say that, fundamentally, the difference between gerontology and geriatrics is that gerontology tries to inhibit the rate at which metabolism lays down this damage. 
And I'm going to explain exactly what damage is in concrete biological terms in a moment. 
And geriatricians try to hold back the sands of time by stopping the damage converting into pathology. 
And the reason it's a losing battle is because the damage is continuing to accumulate. 
So there's a third approach, if we look at it this way. 
We can call it the "engineering approach," and I claim that the engineering approach is within range. 
The engineering approach does not intervene in any processes. 
It does not intervene in this process or this one. 
And that's good because it means that it's not a losing battle, and it's something that we are within range of being able to do, because it doesn't involve improving on evolution. 
The engineering approach simply says, "Let's go and periodically repair all of these various types of damage -- not necessarily repair them completely, but repair them quite a lot, so that we keep the level of damage down below the threshold that must exist, that causes it to be pathogenic." 
We know that this threshold exists, because we don't get age-related diseases until we're in middle age, even though the damage has been accumulating since before we were born. 
Why do I say that we're in range? Well, this is basically it. 
The point about this slide is actually the bottom. 
If we try to say which bits of metabolism are important for aging, we will be here all night, because basically all of metabolism is important for aging in one way or another. 
This list is just for illustration; it is incomplete. 
The list on the right is also incomplete. 
It's a list of types of pathology that are age-related, and it's just an incomplete list. 
But I would like to claim to you that this list in the middle is actually complete -- this is the list of types of thing that qualify as damage, side effects of metabolism that cause pathology in the end, or that might cause pathology. 
And there are only seven of them. 
They're categories of things, of course, but there's only seven of them. 
Cell loss, mutations in chromosomes, mutations in the mitochondria and so on. 
First of all, I'd like to give you an argument for why that list is complete. 
Of course one can make a biological argument. 
One can say, "OK, what are we made of?" 
We're made of cells and stuff between cells. 
What can damage accumulate in? 
The answer is: long-lived molecules, because if a short-lived molecule undergoes damage, but then the molecule is destroyed -- like by a protein being destroyed by proteolysis -- then the damage is gone, too. 
It's got to be long-lived molecules. 
So, these seven things were all under discussion in gerontology a long time ago and that is pretty good news, because it means that, you know, we've come a long way in biology in these 20 years, so the fact that we haven't extended this list is a pretty good indication that there's no extension to be done. 
However, it's better than that; we actually know how to fix them all, in mice, in principle -- and what I mean by in principle is, we probably can actually implement these fixes within a decade. 
Some of them are partially implemented already, the ones at the top. 
I haven't got time to go through them at all, but my conclusion is that, if we can actually get suitable funding for this, then we can probably develop robust mouse rejuvenation in only 10 years, but we do need to get serious about it. 
We do need to really start trying. 
So of course, there are some biologists in the audience, and I want to give some answers to some of the questions that you may have. 
You may have been dissatisfied with this talk, but fundamentally you have to go and read this stuff. 
I've published a great deal on this; I cite the experimental work on which my optimism is based, and there's quite a lot of detail there. 
The detail is what makes me confident of my rather aggressive time frames that I'm predicting here. 
So if you think that I'm wrong, you'd better damn well go and find out why you think I'm wrong. 
And of course the main thing is that you shouldn't trust people who call themselves gerontologists because, as with any radical departure from previous thinking within a particular field, you know, you expect people in the mainstream to be a bit resistant and not really to take it seriously. 
So, you know, you've got to actually do your homework, in order to understand whether this is true. 
And we'll just end with a few things. 
One thing is, you know, you'll be hearing from a guy in the next session who said some time ago that he could sequence the human genome in half no time, and everyone said, "Well, it's obviously impossible." 
And you know what happened. 
So, you know, this does happen. 
We have various strategies -- there's the Methuselah Mouse Prize, which is basically an incentive to innovate, and to do what you think is going to work, and you get money for it if you win. 
There's a proposal to actually put together an institute. 
This is what's going to take a bit of money. 
But, I mean, look -- how long does it take to spend that on the war in Iraq? 
Not very long. OK. 
 It's got to be philanthropic, because profits distract biotech, but it's basically got a 90 percent chance, I think, of succeeding in this. 
And I think we know how to do it. And I'll stop there. 
Thank you. 
 Chris Anderson: OK. I don't know if there's going to be any questions but I thought I would give people the chance. 
Audience: Since you've been talking about aging and trying to defeat it, why is it that you make yourself appear like an old man? 
 AG: Because I am an old man. I am actually 158. 
  Audience: Species on this planet have evolved with immune systems to fight off all the diseases so that individuals live long enough to procreate. 
However, as far as I know, all the species have evolved to actually die, so when cells divide, the telomerase get shorter, and eventually species die. 
So, why does -- evolution has -- seems to have selected against immortality, when it is so advantageous, or is evolution just incomplete? 
AG: Brilliant. Thank you for asking a question that I can answer with an uncontroversial answer. 
I'm going to tell you the genuine mainstream answer to your question, which I happen to agree with, which is that, no, aging is not a product of selection, evolution; [aging] is simply a product of evolutionary neglect. 
In other words, we have aging because it's hard work not to have aging; you need more genetic pathways, more sophistication in your genes in order to age more slowly, and that carries on being true the longer you push it out. 
So, to the extent that evolution doesn't matter, doesn't care whether genes are passed on by individuals, living a long time or by procreation, there's a certain amount of modulation of that, which is why different species have different lifespans, but that's why there are no immortal species. 
CA: The genes don't care but we do? 
AG: That's right. 
Audience: Hello. I read somewhere that in the last 20 years, the average lifespan of basically anyone on the planet has grown by 10 years. 
If I project that, that would make me think that I would live until 120 if I don't crash on my motorbike. 
That means that I'm one of your subjects to become a 1,000-year-old? 
AG: If you lose a bit of weight. 
 Your numbers are a bit out. 
The standard numbers are that lifespans have been growing at between one and two years per decade. 
So, it's not quite as good as you might think, you might hope. 
But I intend to move it up to one year per year as soon as possible. 
Audience: I was told that many of the brain cells we have as adults are actually in the human embryo, and that the brain cells last 80 years or so. 
If that is indeed true, biologically are there implications in the world of rejuvenation? 
If there are cells in my body that live all 80 years, as opposed to a typical, you know, couple of months? 
AG: There are technical implications certainly. 
Basically what we need to do is replace cells in those few areas of the brain that lose cells at a respectable rate, especially neurons, but we don't want to replace them any faster than that -- or not much faster anyway, because replacing them too fast would degrade cognitive function. 
What I said about there being no non-aging species earlier on was a little bit of an oversimplification. 
There are species that have no aging -- Hydra for example -- but they do it by not having a nervous system -- and not having any tissues in fact that rely for their function on very long-lived cells.

<title>Frans Lanting: The story of life in photographs</title> 
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: In this stunning slideshow, celebrated nature photographer Frans Lanting presents The LIFE Project, a poetic collection of photographs that tell the story of our planet, from its eruptive beginnings to its present diversity. Soundtrack by Philip Glass.</description> 
Nature's my muse and it's been my passion. 
As a photographer for National Geographic, I've portrayed it for many. 
But five years ago, I went on a personal journey. 
I wanted to visualize the story of life. 
It's the hardest thing I've ever attempted, and there have been plenty of times when I felt like backing out. 
But there were also revelations. 
And one of those I'd like to share with you today. 
I went down to a remote lagoon in Australia, hoping to see the Earth the way it was three billion years ago, back before the sky turned blue. 
There's stromatolites down there -- the first living things to capture photosynthesis -- and it's the only place they still occur today. 
Going down there was like entering a time capsule, and I came out with a different sense of myself in time. 
The oxygen exhaled by those stromatolites is what we all breathe today. 
Stromatolites are the heroes in my story. 
I hope it's a story that has some resonance for our time. 
It's a story about you and me, nature and science. 
And with that said, I'd like to invite you for a short, brief journey of life through time. 
Our journey starts in space, where matter condenses into spheres over time ... 
solidifying into surface, molded by fire. 
The fire gave way, Earth emerged -- but this was an alien planet. 
The moon was closer; things were different. 
Heat from within made geysers erupt -- that is how the oceans were born. 
Water froze around the poles and shaped the edges of the Earth. 
Water is the key to life, but in frozen form, it is a latent force. 
And when it vanishes, Earth becomes Mars. 
But this planet is different -- it's roiling inside. 
And where that energy touches water, something new emerges: life. 
It arises around cracks in the Earth. 
Mud and minerals become substrate; there are bacteria. 
Learn to multiply, thickening in places ... 
Growing living structures under an alien sky ... 
Stromatolites were the first to exhale oxygen. 
And they changed the atmosphere. 
A breath that's fossilized now as iron. 
Meteorites delivered chemistry, and perhaps membranes, too. 
Life needs a membrane to contain itself so it can replicate and mutate. 
These are diatoms, single-celled phytoplankton with skeletons of silicon ... 
circuit boards of the future. 
Shallow seas nurtured life early on, and that's where it morphed into more complex forms. 
It grew as light and oxygen increased. 
Life hardened and became defensive. 
It learned to move and began to see. The first eyes grew on trilobites. 
Vision was refined in horseshoe crabs, among the first to leave the sea. 
They still do what they've done for ages, their enemies long gone. 
Scorpions follow prey out of the sea. Slugs became snails. 
Fish tried amphibian life. Frogs adapted to deserts. 
Lichens arose as a co-op. Fungi married algae ... 
clinging to rock, and eating it too ... transforming barren land. 
True land plants arose, leafless at first. 
Once they learn how to stay upright, they grew in size and shape. 
The fundamental forms of ferns followed, to bear spores that foreshadowed seeds. 
Life flourished in swamps. 
On land, life turned a corner. Jaws formed first; teeth came later. 
Leatherbacks and tuataras are echoes from that era. 
It took time for life to break away from water, and it still beckons all the time. 
Life turned hard so it could venture inland. 
And the dragons that arose are still among us today. 
Jurassic Park still shimmers in part of Madagascar, and the center of Brazil, where plants called "cycads" remain rock hard. 
Forests arose and nurtured things with wings. 
One early form left an imprint, like it died only yesterday. 
And others fly today like echoes of the past. 
In birds, life gained new mobility. 
Flamingos covered continents. Migrations got underway. 
Birds witnessed the emergence of flowering plants. 
Water lilies were among the first. 
Plants began to diversify and grew, turning into trees. 
In Australia, a lily turned into a grass tree, and in Hawaii, a daisy became a silver sword. 
In Africa, Gondwana molded Proteas. 
But when that ancient continent broke up, life got lusher. 
Tropical rainforests arose, sparking new layers of interdependence. 
Fungi multiplied. Orchids emerged, genitalia shaped to lure insects ... 
a trick shared by the largest flower on Earth. 
Co-evolution entwined insects and birds and plants forever. 
When birds can't fly, they become vulnerable. 
Kiwis are, and so are these hawks trapped near Antarctica. 
Extinction can come slowly, but sometimes it arrives fast. 
An asteroid hits, and the world went down in flames. 
But there were witnesses, survivors in the dark. 
When the skies cleared, a new world was born. 
A world fit for mammals. From tiny shrews [came] tenrecs, accustomed to the dark. 
New forms became bats. Civets. 
New predators, hyenas, getting faster and faster still. 
Grasslands created opportunities. 
Herd safety came with sharpened senses. 
Growing big was another answer, but size always comes at a price. 
Some mammals turned back to water. 
Walruses adapted with layers of fat. Sea lions got sleek. 
And cetaceans moved into a world without bounds. 
There are many ways to be a mammal. A 'roo hops in Oz; a horse runs in Asia; and a wolf evolves stilt legs in Brazil. 
Primates emerge from jungles, as tarsiers first, becoming lemurs not much later. 
Learning became reinforced. Bands of apes ventured into the open. 
And forests dried out once more. Going upright became a lifestyle. 
So who are we? Brothers of masculine chimps, sisters of feminine bonobos? We are all of them, and more. 
We're molded by the same life force. 
The blood veins in our hands echoed a course of water traces on the Earth. 
And our brains -- our celebrated brains -- reflect a drainage of a tidal marsh. 
Life is a force in its own right. It is a new element. 
And it has altered the Earth. It covers Earth like a skin. 
And where it doesn't, as in Greenland in winter, Mars is still not very far. 
But that likelihood fades as long as ice melts again. 
And where water is liquid, it becomes a womb for cells green with chlorophyll -- and that molecular marvel is what's made a difference -- it powers everything. 
The whole animal world today lives on a stockpile of bacterial oxygen that is cycled constantly through plants and algae, and their waste is our breath, and vice versa. 
This Earth is alive, and it's made its own membrane. 
We call it "atmosphere." This is the icon of our journey. 
And you all here today can imagine and will shape where we go next. 
 Thank you. Thank you.

<title>Nicholas Negroponte: One Laptop per Child</title> 
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Nicholas Negroponte, founder of the MIT Media Laboratory, describes how the One Laptop Per Child project will build and distribute the "$100 laptop."</description> 
I've been at MIT for 44 years. I went to TED I. 
There's only one other person here, I think, who did that. 
All the other TEDs -- and I went to them all, under Ricky's regime -- I talked about what the Media Lab was doing, which today has almost 500 people in it. 
And if you read the press, last week it actually said I quit the Media Lab. 
I didn't quit the Media Lab, I stepped down as chairman -- which was a kind of ridiculous title, but someone else has taken it on -- and one of the things you can do as a professor is you stay on as a professor. 
And I will now do for the rest of my life the One Laptop Per Child, which I've sort of been doing for a year and a half, anyway. 
So I'm going to tell you about this, use my 18 minutes to tell you why we're doing it, how we're doing it and then what we're doing. 
And at some point I'll even pass around what the $100 laptop might be like. 
I was asked by Chris to talk about some of the big issues, and so I figured I'd start with the three that at least drove me to do this. 
And the first is pretty obvious. 
It's amazing when you meet a head of state, and you say, "What is your most precious natural resource?" 
They will not say "children" at first, and then when you say, "children," they will pretty quickly agree with you. 
And so that isn't very hard. 
Everybody agrees that whatever the solutions are to the big problems, they include education, sometimes can be just education and can never be without some element of education. 
So that's certainly part of it. 
And the third is a little bit less obvious. 
And that is that we all in this room learned how to walk, how to talk, not by being taught how to talk, or taught how to walk, but by interacting with the world, by having certain results as a consequence of being able to ask for something, or being able to stand up and reach it. 
Whereas at about the age six, we were told to stop learning that way, and that all learning from then on would happen through teaching, whether it's people standing up, like I'm doing now, or a book, or something. 
But it was really through teaching. 
And one of the things in general that computers have provided to learning is that it now includes a kind of learning which is a little bit more like walking and talking, in the sense that a lot of it is driven by the learner himself or herself. 
So with those as the principles -- some of you may know Seymour Papert. 
This is back in 1982, when we were working in Senegal. 
Because some people think that the $100 laptop just happened a year ago, or two years ago, or we were struck by lightning -- this actually has gone back a long time, and in fact, back to the '60s. 
Here we're in the '80s. 
Steve Jobs had given us some laptops. We were in Senegal. 
It didn't scale but it at least was bringing computers to developing countries and learning pretty quickly that these kids, even though English wasn't their language, the Latin alphabet barely was their language, but they could just swim like fish. 
They could play these like pianos. 
A little bit more recently, I got involved personally. 
And these are two anecdotes -- one was in Cambodia, in a village that has no electricity, no water, no television, no telephone, but has broadband Internet now. 
And these kids, their first English word is "Google" and they only know Skype. They've never heard of telephony. 
They just use Skype. 
And they go home at night -- they've got a broadband connection in a hut that doesn't have electricity. 
The parents love it, because when they open up the laptops, it's the brightest light source in the house. 
And talk about where metaphors and reality mix -- this is the actual school. 
In parallel with this, Seymour Papert got the governor of Maine to legislate one laptop per child in the year 2002. 
Now at the time, I think it's fair to say that 80 percent of the teachers were -- let me say, apprehensive. 
Really, they were actually against it. 
And they really preferred that the money would be used for higher salaries, more schools, whatever. 
And now, three and a half years later, guess what? 
They're reporting five things: drop of truancy to almost zero, attending parent-teacher meetings -- which nobody did and now almost everybody does -- drop in discipline problems, increase in student participation. 
Teachers are now saying it's kind of fun to teach. 
Kids are engaged -- they have laptops! -- and then the fifth, which interests me the most, is that the servers have to be turned off at certain times at night because the teachers are getting too much email from the kids asking them for help. 
So when you see that kind of thing -- this is not something that you have to test. 
The days of pilot projects are over, when people say, "We'd like to do three or four thousand in our country to see how it works." 
Screw you. Go to the back of the line and someone else will do it, and then when you figure out that this works, you can join as well. 
And this is what we're doing. 
  So, One Laptop Per Child was formed about a year and a half ago. 
It's a nonprofit association. It raised about 20 million dollars to do the engineering to just get this built, and then have it produced afterwards. 
Scale is truly important. 
And it's not important because you can buy components at a lower price, OK? 
It's because you can go to a manufacturer -- and I will leave the name out -- but we wanted a small display, doesn't have to have perfect color uniformity. 
It can even have a pixel or two missing. It doesn't have to be that bright. 
And this particular manufacturer said, "We're not interested in that. We're interested in the living room. 
We're interested in perfect color uniformity. 
We're interested in big displays, bright displays. 
You're not part of our strategic plan." 
And I said, "That's kind of too bad, because we need 100 million units a year." 
And they said, "Oh, well, maybe we could become part of your strategic plan." 
And that's why scale counts. 
And that's why we will not launch this without five to 10 million units in the first run. 
And the idea is to launch with enough scale that the scale itself helps bring the price down, and that's why I said seven to 10 million there. 
And we're doing it without a sales-and-marketing team. 
I mean, you're looking at the sales-and-marketing team. 
We will do it by going to seven large countries and getting them to agree and launch it, and then the others can follow. 
We have partners. It's not hard to guess Google would be one. 
The others are all playing to pending. 
And this has been in the press a great deal. 
It's the so-called Green Machine that we introduced with Kofi Annan in November at the World Summit that was held in Tunisia. 
Now once people start looking at this, they say, "Ah, this is a laptop project." 
Well, no, it's not a laptop project. It's an education project. 
And the fun part -- and I'm quite focused on it -- I tell people I used to be a light bulb, but now I'm a laser -- I'm just going to get that thing built, and it turns out it's not so hard. 
Because laptop economics are the following: I say 50 percent here -- it's more like 60, 60 percent of the cost of your laptop is sales, marketing, distribution and profit. 
Now we have none of those, OK? 
None of those figure into our cost, because first of all, we sell it at cost, and the governments distribute it. 
It gets distributed to the school system like a textbook. 
So that piece disappears. Then you have display and everything else. 
Now the display on your laptop costs, in rough numbers, 10 dollars a diagonal inch. 
That can drop to eight; it can drop to seven but it's not going to drop to two, or to one and a half, unless we do some pretty clever things. 
It's the rest -- that little brown box -- that is pretty fascinating, because the rest of your laptop is devoted to itself. 
It's a little bit like an obese person having to use most of their energy to move their obesity. 
And we have a situation today which is incredible. 
I've been using laptops since their inception. 
And my laptop runs slower, less reliably and less pleasantly than it ever has before. 
And this year is worse. 
 People clap, sometimes you even get standing ovations, and I say, "What the hell's wrong with you? Why are we all sitting there?" 
And somebody -- to remain nameless -- called our laptop a "gadget" recently. 
And I said, "God, our laptop's going to go like a bat out of hell. 
When you open it up, it's going to go 'bing.'" It'll be on. 
It'll be just like it was in 1985, when you bought an Apple Macintosh 512. 
It worked really well. 
And we've been going steadily downhill. 
Now, people ask all the time what it is. 
That's what it is. 
The two pieces that are probably notable: it'll be a mesh network, so when the kids open up their laptops, they all become a network, and then just need one or two points of backhaul. 
You can serve a couple of thousand kids with two megabits. 
So you really can bring into a village, and then the villages can connect themselves, and you really can do it quite well. 
The dual mode display -- the idea is to have a display that both works outdoors -- isn't it fun using your cell phone outdoors in the sunlight? 
Well, you can't see it. 
And one of the reasons you can't see it is because it's backlighting most of the time, most cell phones. 
Now, what we're doing is, we're doing one that will be both frontlit and backlit. 
And whether you manually switch it or you do it in the software is to be seen. 
But when it's backlit, it's color. 
And when it's frontlit, it's black and white at three times the resolution. 
Is it all worked out? No. 
That's why a lot of our people are more or less living in Taiwan right now. 
And in about 30 days, we'll know for sure whether this works. 
Probably the most important piece there is that the kids really can do the maintenance. 
And this is again something that people don't believe, but I really think it's quite true. 
That's the machine we showed in Tunis. 
This is more the direction that we're going to go. 
And it's something that we didn't think was possible. 
Now, I'm going to pass this around. 
This isn't a design, OK? 
So this is just a mechanical engineering sort of embodiment of it for you to play with. 
And it's clearly just a model. 
The working one is at MIT. 
I'm going to pass it to this handsome gentleman. 
At least you can decide whether it goes left or -- Chris Anderson: Before you do it, for the people down in simulcast -- Nicholas Negroponte: Sorry! I forgot. CA: Just show it off a bit. 
So wherever the camera is -- OK, good point. Thank you, Chris. 
The idea was that it would be not only a laptop, but that it could transform into an electronic book. 
So it's sort of an electronic book. 
This is where when you go outside, it's in black and white. 
The games buttons are missing, but it'll also be a games machine, book machine. 
Set it up this way, and it's a television set. 
Etc., etc. -- is that enough for simulcast? OK, sorry. 
I'll let Jim decide which way to send it afterwards. 
OK. Seven countries.  I say "maybe" for Massachusetts, because they actually have to do a bid. 
By law you've got to bid, and so on and so forth. 
So I can't quite name them. 
In the other cases, they don't have to do bids. They can decide -- it's the federal government in each case. 
It's kind of agonizing, because a lot of people say, "Let's do it at the state level," because states are more nimble than the feds, just because of size. 
And yet we count. 
We're really dealing with the federal government. 
We're really dealing with ministries of education. 
And if you look at governments around the world, ministries of education tend to be the most conservative, and also the ones that have huge payrolls. 
Everybody thinks they know about education, a lot of culture is built into it as well. 
It's really hard. And so it's certainly the hard road. 
If you look at the countries, they're pretty geoculturally distributed. 
Have they all agreed? No, not completely. 
Probably Thailand, Brazil and Nigeria are the three that are the most active and most agreed. 
We're purposely not signing anything with anybody until we actually have the working ones. 
And since I visit each one of those countries within at least every three months, I'm just going around the world every three weeks. 
Here's sort of the schedule and I put at the bottom we might give some away free in two years at this meeting. 
Everybody says it's a $100 laptop -- you can't do it. 
Well, guess what, we're not. 
We're coming in probably at 135, to start, then drift down. 
And that's very important, because so many things hit the market at a price and then drift up. 
It's kind of the loss leader, and then as soon as it looks interesting, it can't be afforded, or it can't be scaled out. 
So we're targeting 50 dollars in 2010. 
The gray market's a big issue. And one of the ways -- just one -- but one of the ways to help in the case of the gray market is to make something that is so utterly unique -- It's a little bit like the fact that automobiles -- thousands of automobiles are stolen every day in the United States. 
Not one single post-office truck is stolen.  And why? 
Because there's no market for post-office trucks. 
It looks like a post-office truck. 
You can spray paint it. You can do anything you want. 
I just learned recently: in South Africa, no white Volvos are stolen. 
Period. None. Zero. 
So we want to make it very much like a white Volvo. 
Each government has a task force. This perhaps is less interesting, but we're trying to get the governments to all work together and it's not easy. 
The economics of this is to start with the federal governments and then later, to subsequently go to other -- whether it's child-to-child funding, so a child in this country buys one for a child in the developing world, maybe of the same gender, maybe of the same age. 
An uncle gives a niece or a nephew that as a birthday present. 
I mean, there are all sorts of things that will happen, and they'll be very, very exciting. 
And everybody says -- I say -- it's an education project. 
Are we providing the software? 
The answer is: The system certainly has software, but no, we're not providing the education content. 
That is really done in the countries. 
But we are certainly constructionists. 
And we certainly believe in learning by doing and everything from Logo, which was started in 1968, to more modern things, like Scratch, if you've ever even heard of it, are very, very much part of it. 
And that's the rollout. 
Are we dreaming? Is this real? It actually is real. 
The only criticism, and people really don't want to criticize this, because it is a humanitarian effort, a nonprofit effort and to criticize it is a little bit stupid, actually.  But the one thing that people could criticize was, "Great idea, but these guys can't do it." 
And that could either mean these guys, professors and so on couldn't do it, or that it's not possible. 
Well, on December 12, a company called Quanta agreed to build it, and since they make about one-third of all the laptops on the planet today, that question disappeared. 
So it's not a matter of whether it's going to happen. 
And if it comes out at 138 dollars, so what? 
If it comes out six months late, so what? 
That's a pretty soft landing. Thank you.

<title>Martin Rees: Is this our final century?</title> 
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Speaking as both an astronomer and "a concerned member of the human race," Sir Martin Rees examines our planet and its future from a cosmic perspective. He urges action to prevent dark consequences from our scientific and technological development.</description> 
If you take 10,000 people at random, 9,999 have something in common: their interests in business lie on or near the Earth's surface. 
The odd one out is an astronomer, and I am one of that strange breed. 
 My talk will be in two parts. I'll talk first as an astronomer, and then as a worried member of the human race. 
But let's start off by remembering that Darwin showed how we're the outcome of four billion years of evolution. 
And what we try to do in astronomy and cosmology is to go back before Darwin's simple beginning, to set our Earth in a cosmic context. 
And let me just run through a few slides. 
This was the impact that happened last week on a comet. 
If they'd sent a nuke, it would have been rather more spectacular than what actually happened last Monday. 
So that's another project for NASA. 
That's Mars from the European Mars Express, and at New Year. 
This artist's impression turned into reality when a parachute landed on Titan, Saturn's giant moon. 
It landed on the surface. This is pictures taken on the way down. 
That looks like a coastline. 
It is indeed, but the ocean is liquid methane -- the temperature minus 170 degrees centigrade. 
If we go beyond our solar system, we've learned that the stars aren't twinkly points of light. 
Each one is like a sun with a retinue of planets orbiting around it. 
And we can see places where stars are forming, like the Eagle Nebula. We see stars dying. 
In six billion years, the sun will look like that. 
And some stars die spectacularly in a supernova explosion, leaving remnants like that. 
On a still bigger scale, we see entire galaxies of stars. 
We see entire ecosystems where gas is being recycled. 
And to the cosmologist, these galaxies are just the atoms, as it were, of the large-scale universe. 
This picture shows a patch of sky so small that it would take about 100 patches like it to cover the full moon in the sky. 
Through a small telescope, this would look quite blank, but you see here hundreds of little, faint smudges. 
Each is a galaxy, fully like ours or Andromeda, which looks so small and faint because its light has taken 10 billion light-years to get to us. 
The stars in those galaxies probably don't have planets around them. 
There's scant chance of life there -- that's because there's been no time for the nuclear fusion in stars to make silicon and carbon and iron, the building blocks of planets and of life. 
We believe that all of this emerged from a Big Bang -- a hot, dense state. So how did that amorphous Big Bang turn into our complex cosmos? 
I'm going to show you a movie simulation 16 powers of 10 faster than real time, which shows a patch of the universe where the expansions have subtracted out. 
But you see, as time goes on in gigayears at the bottom, you will see structures evolve as gravity feeds on small, dense irregularities, and structures develop. 
And we'll end up after 13 billion years with something looking rather like our own universe. 
And we compare simulated universes like that -- I'll show you a better simulation at the end of my talk -- with what we actually see in the sky. 
Well, we can trace things back to the earlier stages of the Big Bang, but we still don't know what banged and why it banged. 
That's a challenge for 21st-century science. 
If my research group had a logo, it would be this picture here: an ouroboros, where you see the micro-world on the left -- the world of the quantum -- and on the right the large-scale universe of planets, stars and galaxies. 
We know our universes are united though -- links between left and right. 
The everyday world is determined by atoms, how they stick together to make molecules. 
Stars are fueled by how the nuclei in those atoms react together. 
And, as we've learned in the last few years, galaxies are held together by the gravitational pull of so-called dark matter: particles in huge swarms, far smaller even than atomic nuclei. 
But we'd like to know the synthesis symbolized at the very top. 
The micro-world of the quantum is understood. 
On the right hand side, gravity holds sway. Einstein explained that. 
But the unfinished business for 21st-century science is to link together cosmos and micro-world with a unified theory -- symbolized, as it were, gastronomically at the top of that picture.  And until we have that synthesis, we won't be able to understand the very beginning of our universe because when our universe was itself the size of an atom, quantum effects could shake everything. 
And so we need a theory that unifies the very large and the very small, which we don't yet have. 
One idea, incidentally -- and I had this hazard sign to say I'm going to speculate from now on -- is that our Big Bang was not the only one. 
One idea is that our three-dimensional universe may be embedded in a high-dimensional space, just as you can imagine on these sheets of paper. 
You can imagine ants on one of them thinking it's a two-dimensional universe, not being aware of another population of ants on the other. 
So there could be another universe just a millimeter away from ours, but we're not aware of it because that millimeter is measured in some fourth spatial dimension, and we're imprisoned in our three. 
And so we believe that there may be a lot more to physical reality than what we've normally called our universe -- the aftermath of our Big Bang. And here's another picture. 
Bottom right depicts our universe, which on the horizon is not beyond that, but even that is just one bubble, as it were, in some vaster reality. 
Many people suspect that just as we've gone from believing in one solar system to zillions of solar systems, one galaxy to many galaxies, we have to go to many Big Bangs from one Big Bang, perhaps these many Big Bangs displaying an immense variety of properties. 
Well, let's go back to this picture. 
There's one challenge symbolized at the top, but there's another challenge to science symbolized at the bottom. 
You want to not only synthesize the very large and the very small, but we want to understand the very complex. 
And the most complex things are ourselves, midway between atoms and stars. 
We depend on stars to make the atoms we're made of. 
We depend on chemistry to determine our complex structure. 
We clearly have to be large, compared to atoms, to have layer upon layer of complex structure. 
We clearly have to be small, compared to stars and planets -- otherwise we'd be crushed by gravity. And in fact, we are midway. 
It would take as many human bodies to make up the sun as there are atoms in each of us. 
The geometric mean of the mass of a proton and the mass of the sun is 50 kilograms, within a factor of two of the mass of each person here. 
Well, most of you anyway. 
The science of complexity is probably the greatest challenge of all, greater than that of the very small on the left and the very large on the right. 
And it's this science, which is not only enlightening our understanding of the biological world, but also transforming our world faster than ever. 
And more than that, it's engendering new kinds of change. 
And I now move on to the second part of my talk, and the book "Our Final Century" was mentioned. 
If I was not a self-effacing Brit, I would mention the book myself, and I would add that it's available in paperback. 
 And in America it was called "Our Final Hour" because Americans like instant gratification. 
 But my theme is that in this century, not only has science changed the world faster than ever, but in new and different ways. 
Targeted drugs, genetic modification, artificial intelligence, perhaps even implants into our brains, may change human beings themselves. And human beings, their physique and character, has not changed for thousands of years. 
It may change this century. 
It's new in our history. 
And the human impact on the global environment -- greenhouse warming, mass extinctions and so forth -- is unprecedented, too. 
And so, this makes this coming century a challenge. 
Bio- and cybertechnologies are environmentally benign in that they offer marvelous prospects, while, nonetheless, reducing pressure on energy and resources. 
But they will have a dark side. 
In our interconnected world, novel technology could empower just one fanatic, or some weirdo with a mindset of those who now design computer viruses, to trigger some kind on disaster. 
Indeed, catastrophe could arise simply from technical misadventure -- error rather than terror. 
And even a tiny probability of catastrophe is unacceptable when the downside could be of global consequence. 
In fact, some years ago, Bill Joy wrote an article expressing tremendous concern about robots taking us over, etc. 
I don't go along with all that, but it's interesting that he had a simple solution. 
It was what he called "fine-grained relinquishment." 
He wanted to give up the dangerous kind of science and keep the good bits. Now, that's absurdly naive for two reasons. 
First, any scientific discovery has benign consequences as well as dangerous ones. 
And also, when a scientist makes a discovery, he or she normally has no clue what the applications are going to be. 
And so what this means is that we have to accept the risks if we are going to enjoy the benefits of science. 
We have to accept that there will be hazards. 
And I think we have to go back to what happened in the post-War era, post-World War II, when the nuclear scientists who'd been involved in making the atomic bomb, in many cases were concerned that they should do all they could to alert the world to the dangers. 
And they were inspired not by the young Einstein, who did the great work in relativity, but by the old Einstein, the icon of poster and t-shirt, who failed in his scientific efforts to unify the physical laws. 
He was premature. But he was a moral compass -- an inspiration to scientists who were concerned with arms control. 
And perhaps the greatest living person is someone I'm privileged to know, Joe Rothblatt. 
Equally untidy office there, as you can see. 
He's 96 years old, and he founded the Pugwash movement. 
He persuaded Einstein, as his last act, to sign the famous memorandum of Bertrand Russell. 
And he sets an example of the concerned scientist. 
And I think to harness science optimally, to choose which doors to open and which to leave closed, we need latter-day counterparts of people like Joseph Rothblatt. 
We need not just campaigning physicists, but we need biologists, computer experts and environmentalists as well. 
And I think academics and independent entrepreneurs have a special obligation because they have more freedom than those in government service, or company employees subject to commercial pressure. 
I wrote my book, "Our Final Century," as a scientist, just a general scientist. But there's one respect, I think, in which being a cosmologist offered a special perspective, and that's that it offers an awareness of the immense future. 
The stupendous time spans of the evolutionary past are now part of common culture -- outside the American Bible Belt, anyway --  but most people, even those who are familiar with evolution, aren't mindful that even more time lies ahead. 
The sun has been shining for four and a half billion years, but it'll be another six billion years before its fuel runs out. 
On that schematic picture, a sort of time-lapse picture, we're halfway. 
And it'll be another six billion before that happens, and any remaining life on Earth is vaporized. 
There's an unthinking tendency to imagine that humans will be there, experiencing the sun's demise, but any life and intelligence that exists then will be as different from us as we are from bacteria. 
The unfolding of intelligence and complexity still has immensely far to go, here on Earth and probably far beyond. 
So we are still at the beginning of the emergence of complexity in our Earth and beyond. 
If you represent the Earth's lifetime by a single year, say from January when it was made to December, the 21st-century would be a quarter of a second in June -- a tiny fraction of the year. 
But even in this concertinaed cosmic perspective, our century is very, very special, the first when humans can change themselves and their home planet. 
As I should have shown this earlier, it will not be humans who witness the end point of the sun; it will be creatures as different from us as we are from bacteria. 
When Einstein died in 1955, one striking tribute to his global status was this cartoon by Herblock in the Washington Post. 
The plaque reads, "Albert Einstein lived here." 
And I'd like to end with a vignette, as it were, inspired by this image. 
We've been familiar for 40 years with this image: the fragile beauty of land, ocean and clouds, contrasted with the sterile moonscape on which the astronauts left their footprints. 
But let's suppose some aliens had been watching our pale blue dot in the cosmos from afar, not just for 40 years, but for the entire 4.5 billion-year history of our Earth. 
What would they have seen? 
Over nearly all that immense time, Earth's appearance would have changed very gradually. 
The only abrupt worldwide change would have been major asteroid impacts or volcanic super-eruptions. 
Apart from those brief traumas, nothing happens suddenly. 
The continental landmasses drifted around. 
Ice cover waxed and waned. 
Successions of new species emerged, evolved and became extinct. 
But in just a tiny sliver of the Earth's history, the last one-millionth part, a few thousand years, the patterns of vegetation altered much faster than before. 
This signaled the start of agriculture. 
Change has accelerated as human populations rose. 
Then other things happened even more abruptly. 
Within just 50 years -- that's one hundredth of one millionth of the Earth's age -- the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere started to rise, and ominously fast. 
The planet became an intense emitter of radio waves -- the total output from all TV and cell phones and radar transmissions. And something else happened. 
Metallic objects -- albeit very small ones, a few tons at most -- escaped into orbit around the Earth. 
Some journeyed to the moons and planets. 
A race of advanced extraterrestrials watching our solar system from afar could confidently predict Earth's final doom in another six billion years. 
But could they have predicted this unprecedented spike less than halfway through the Earth's life? 
These human-induced alterations occupying overall less than a millionth of the elapsed lifetime and seemingly occurring with runaway speed? 
If they continued their vigil, what might these hypothetical aliens witness in the next hundred years? 
Will some spasm foreclose Earth's future? 
Or will the biosphere stabilize? 
Or will some of the metallic objects launched from the Earth spawn new oases, a post-human life elsewhere? 
The science done by the young Einstein will continue as long as our civilization, but for civilization to survive, we'll need the wisdom of the old Einstein -- humane, global and farseeing. 
And whatever happens in this uniquely crucial century will resonate into the remote future and perhaps far beyond the Earth, far beyond the Earth as depicted here. 
Thank you very much.

<title>Sirena Huang: An 11-year-old's magical violin</title> 
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Violinist Sirena Huang gives a technically brilliant and emotionally nuanced performance. In a charming interlude, the 11-year-old praises the timeless design of her instrument.</description> 
 (Applause ends) Hi, everyone. I'm Sirena. 
I'm 11 years old and from Connecticut. 
 Well, I'm not really sure why I'm here. 
 I mean, what does this have to do with technology, entertainment and design? 
Well, I count my iPod, cellphone and computer as technology, but this has nothing to do with that. 
So I did a little research on it. 
Well, this is what I found. 
Of course, I hope I can memorize it. 
The violin is made of a wood box and four metal strings. 
By pulling a string, it vibrates and produces a sound wave, which passes through a piece of wood called a bridge, and goes down to the wood box and gets amplified, but ... let me think. 
 Placing your finger at different places on the fingerboard changes the string length, and that changes the frequency of the sound wave. 
 Oh, my gosh! 
 OK, this is sort of technology, but I can call it a 16th-century technology. 
But actually, the most fascinating thing that I found was that even the audio system or wave transmission nowadays are still based on the same principle of producing and projecting sound. 
Isn't that cool? 
  Design -- I love its design. 
I remember when I was little, my mom asked me, "Would you like to play the violin or the piano?" 
I looked at that giant monster and said to myself -- "I am not going to lock myself on that bench the whole day!" 
 This is small and lightweight. 
I can play from standing, sitting or walking. 
And, you know what? 
The best of all is that if I don't want to practice,  I can hide it. 
 The violin is very beautiful. 
Some people relate it as the shape of a lady. 
But whether you like it or not, it's been so for more than 400 years, unlike modern stuff [that] easily looks dated. 
But I think it's very personal and unique that, although each violin looks pretty similar, no two violins sound the same -- even from the same maker or based on the same model. 
Entertainment -- I love the entertainment. 
But actually, the instrument itself isn't very entertaining. 
I mean, when I first got my violin and tried to play around on it, it was actually really bad, because it didn't sound the way I'd heard from other kids -- it was so horrible and so scratchy. 
So, it wasn't entertaining at all. 
But besides, my brother found this very funny: Yuk! Yuk! Yuk! 
 A few years later, I heard a joke about the greatest violinist, Jascha Heifetz. 
After Mr. Heifetz's concert, a lady came over and complimented him: "Oh, Mr. Heifetz, your violin sounded so great tonight!" 
And Mr. Heifetz was a very cool person, so he picked up his violin and said, "Funny -- I don't hear anything." 
 Now I realize that as the musician, we human beings, with our great mind, artistic heart and skill, can change this 16th-century technology and a legendary design to a wonderful entertainment. 
Now I know why I'm here. 
  At first, I thought I was just going to be here to perform, but unexpectedly, I learned and enjoyed much more. 
But ... although some of the talks were quite up there for me. 
 Like the multi-dimension stuff. 
I mean, honestly, I'd be happy enough if I could actually get my two dimensions correct in school. 
 But actually, the most impressive thing to me is that -- well, actually, I would also like to say this for all children is to say thank you to all adults, for actually caring for us a lot, and to make our future world much better. 
Thank you.

<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Pianist and composer Jennifer Lin gives a magical performance, talks about the process of creativity and improvises a moving solo piece based on a random sequence of notes.</description> 
 Thank you! 
Thank you very much. 
Like the speaker before me -- I am a TED virgin, I guess. 
I'm also the first time here, and ...  I don't know what to say! 
 I'm really happy that Mr. Anderson invited me. 
I'm really grateful that I get a chance to play for everyone. 
And the song that I just played was by Josef Hofmann. 
It's called "Kaleidoscope." 
And Hofmann is a Polish pianist and composer of the late 19th century, and he's widely considered one of the greatest pianists of all time. 
I have another piece that I'd like to play for you. 
It's called "Abegg Variations," by Robert Schumann, a German 19th-century composer. 
The name "Abegg" is actually A-B-E-G-G, and that's the main theme in the melody. 
That comes from the last name of one of Schumann's female friends. 
 But he wrote that for his wife. 
 So actually, if you listen carefully, there are supposed to be five variations on this Abegg theme. 
It's written around 1834, so even though it's old, I hope you'll like it. 
 Now comes the part that I hate. 
Well, because Mr. Anderson told me that this session is called "Sync and Flow," I was wondering, "What do I know that these geniuses don't?" 
So, I'll talk about musical composition, even though I don't know where to start. 
How do I compose? 
I think Yamaha does a really good job of teaching us how to compose. 
What I do first is, I make a lot of little musical ideas you can just improvise here at the piano -- and I choose one of those to become my main theme, my main melody, like the Abegg that you just heard. 
And once I choose my main theme, I have to decide: Out of all the styles in music, what kind of style do I want? 
And this year, I composed a Romantic style. 
So for inspiration, I listened to Liszt and Tchaikovsky and all the great Romantic composers. 
Next, I make the structure of the entire piece with my teachers. 
They help me plan out the whole piece. 
And then the hard part is filling it in with musical ideas, because then you have to think. 
And then, when the piece takes somewhat of a solified form -- solidified, excuse me -- solidified form, you're supposed to actually polish the piece, polish the details, and then polish the overall performance of the composition. 
And another thing that I enjoy doing is drawing. 
Drawing, because I like to draw, you know, Japanese anime art. 
I think that's a craze among teens right now. 
And once I realized it, there's a parallel between creating music and creating art, because for your motive, or your little initial idea for your drawing, it's your character -- you want to decide who you want to draw, or if you want to draw an original character. 
And then you want to decide: How are you going to draw the character? 
Like, am I going to use one page? Am I going to draw it on the computer? 
Am I going to use a two-page spread like a comic book? 
For a more grandiose effect, I guess. 
And then you have to do the initial sketch of the character, which is like your structure of a piece, and then you add pen and pencil, and whatever details that you need -- that's polishing the drawing. 
And another thing that both of these have in common is your state of mind, because I know I'm one of those teenagers that are really easily distracted. 
So if I'm trying to do homework and I don't feel like it, I'll try to draw or, you know, waste my time. 
And then what happens is, sometimes I absolutely can't draw or I can't compose at all, and then it's like there's too much on your mind. 
You can't focus on what you're supposed to do. 
And sometimes, if you manage to use your time wisely and work on it, you'll get something out of it, but it doesn't come naturally. 
What happens is, if something magical happens, if something natural happens to you, you're able to produce all this beautiful stuff instantly, and then that's what I consider "flow," because that's when everything clicks and you're able to do anything. 
You feel like you're on top of your game and you can do anything you want. 
I'm not going to play my own composition today because, although I did finish it, it's way too long. 
Instead, I'd like to try something called "improvisation." 
I have here seven note cards, one with each note of the musical alphabet. 
And I'd like someone to come up here and choose five -- anyone to come up here and choose five -- and then I can make it into some sort of melody, and I'll improvise it. 
Wow. A volunteer, yay! 
 Jennifer Lin: Nice to meet you. 
Goldie Hawn: Thank you. Choose five? 
JL: Yes, five cards. Any five cards. 
GH: OK, one. JL: OK. GH: Two. JL: Yes. GH: Three. 
GH: Oh, D and F -- too familiar. 
 JL: One more. GH: OK. "E" for "effort." 
JL: Would you mind reading them out in the order that you chose them? 
GH: OK -- C, G, B, A and E. 
JL: Thank you very much! 
GH: You're welcome. And what about these? 
JL: I won't use them. Thank you! 
 Now, she chose C, G, B, A, E. 
I'm going to try to put that in some sort of order. 
OK, that's nice. 
So, I'm going to have a moment to think, and I'll try to make something out of it. 
 The next song, or the encore that I'm going to play is called "Bumble Boogie," by Jack Fina.

<title>Amory Lovins: Winning the oil endgame</title> 
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: In this energizing talk, Amory Lovins lays out his simple plan for weaning the US off oil and revitalizing the economy.</description> 
The old story about climate protection is that it's costly, or it would have been done already. 
So government needs to make us do something painful to fix it. 
The new story about climate protection is that it's not costly, but profitable. 
This was a simple sign error, because it's cheaper to save fuel than to buy fuel, as is well known to companies that do it all the time -- for example, Dupont, SD micro electronics. 
Many other firms -- IBM -- are reducing their energy intensity routinely six percent a year by fixing up their plants, and they get their money back in two or three years. 
That's called a profit. 
Now, similarly, the old story about oil is that if we wanted to save very much of it, it would be expensive, or we would have done it already, because markets are essentially perfect. 
If, of course, that were true, there would be no innovation, and nobody could make any money. 
But the new story about oil is the government doesn't have to force us to do painful things to get off oil -- not just incrementally, but completely -- quite the contrary. The United States, for example, can completely eliminate its use of oil and rejuvenate the economy at the same time, led by business for profit, because it's so much cheaper to save and substitute for the oil 
than to keep on buying it. 
This process will also be catalyzed by the military for its own reasons of combat effectiveness and preventing conflict, particularly over oil. 
This thesis is set out in a book called "Winning the Oil Endgame" that four colleagues and I wrote and have posted for free at Oilendgame.com -- about 170,000 downloads so far. 
And it was co-sponsored by the Pentagon -- it's independent, it's peer-reviewed and all of the backup calculations are transparently posted for your perusal. 
Now, a bit of economic history, I think, may be helpful here. 
Around 1850, one of the biggest U.S. industries was whaling. 
And whale oil lit practically every building. 
But in the nine years before Drake struck oil, in 1859, at least five-sixths of that whale oil-illuminating market disappeared, thanks to fatal competitors, chiefly oil and gas made from coal, to which the whalers had not been paying attention. 
So, very unexpectedly, they ran out of customers before they ran out of whales. 
The remnant whale populations were saved by technological innovators and profit-maximizing capitalists. 
 And it's funny -- it feels a bit like this now for oil. 
We've been spending the last few decades accumulating a very powerful backlog of technologies for saving and substituting for oil, and no one had bothered to add them up before. 
So when we did, we found some very surprising things. 
Now, there are two big reasons to be concerned about oil. 
Both national competitiveness and national security are at risk. 
On the competitiveness front, we all know that Toyota has more market cap than the big three put together. 
And serious competition from Europe, from Korea, and next is China, which will soon be a major net exporter of cars. 
How long do you think it will take before you can drive home your new wally-badged Shanghai automotive super-efficient car? 
Maybe a decade, according to my friends in Detroit. 
China has an energy policy based on radical energy efficiency and leap-frog technology. 
They're not going to export your uncle's Buick. 
And after that comes India. 
The point here is, these cars are going to be made super efficient. 
The question is, who will make them? 
Will we in the United States continue to import efficient cars to replace foreign oil, or will we make efficient cars and import neither the oil nor the cars? 
That seems to make more sense. 
The more we keep on using the oil, particularly the imported oil, the more we face a very obvious array of problems. 
Our analysis assumes that they all cost nothing, but nothing is not the right number. 
It could well be enough to double the oil price, for example. 
And one of the worst of these is what it does to our standing in the world if other countries think that everything we do is about oil, if we have to treat countries that have oil differently than countries that don't have oil. 
And our military get quite unhappy with having to stand guard on pipelines in Far-off-istan when what they actually signed up for was to protect American citizens. 
They don't like fighting over oil, they don't like being in the sands and they don't like where the oil money goes and what sort of instability it creates. 
Now, in order to avoid these problems, whatever you think they're worth, it's actually not that complicated. 
We can save half the oil by using it more efficiently, at a cost of 12 dollars per saved barrel. 
And then we can replace the other half with a combination of advanced bio-fuels and safe natural gas. 
And that costs on average under 18 dollars a barrel. 
And compared with the official forecast, that oil will cost 26 dollars a barrel in 2025, which is half of what we've been paying lately, that will save 70 billion dollars a year, starting quite soon. 
Now, in order to do this we need to invest about 180 billion dollars: half of it to retool the car, truck and plane industries; half of it to build the advanced bio-fuel industry. 
In the process, we will gain about a million good jobs, mainly rural. 
And protect another million jobs now at risk, mainly in auto-making. 
And we'll also get returns over 150 billion dollars a year. 
So that's a very handsome return. 
It's financeable in the private capital market. 
But if you want it for the reasons I just mentioned, to happen sooner and with higher confidence, then -- and also to expand choice and manage risk -- then you might like some light-handed public policies that support rather than distorting or opposing the business logic. 
And these policies work fine without taxes, subsidies or mandates. 
They make a little net money for the treasury. 
They have a broad trans-ideological appeal, and because we want them actually to happen, we figured out ways to do them that do not require much, if any, federal legislation, and can, indeed, be done administratively or at a state level. 
Just to illustrate what to do about the nub of the problem, namely, light vehicles, here are four ultra-light carbon-composite concept cars with low drag, and all but the one at the upper left have hybrid drive. 
You can sort of have it all with these things. 
For example, this Opel two-seater does 155 miles an hour at 94 miles a gallon. 
This muscle car from Toyota: 408 horsepower in an ultra-light that does zero to 60 in well under four seconds, and still gets 32 miles a gallon. I'll say more later about this. 
And in the upper left, a pioneering effort 14 years ago by GM -- 84 miles a gallon without even using a hybrid, in a four-seater. 
Well, saving that fuel, 69 percent of the fuel in light vehicles costs about 57 cents per saved gallon. 
But it's even a better deal for heavy trucks, where you save a similar amount at 25 cents a gallon, with better aerodynamics and tires and engines, and so on, and taking out weight so you can put it into payload. 
So you can double efficiency with a 60 percent internal rate of return. 
Then you can go even further, almost tripling efficiency with some operational improvements, double the big haulers' margins. 
And we intend to use those numbers to create demand pull, and flip the market. 
In the airplane business, it's again a similar story where the first 20 percent fuel saving is free, as Boeing is now demonstrating in its new Dreamliner. 
But then the next generation of planes saves about half. 
Again, much cheaper than buying the fuel. 
And if you go over the next 15 years or so to a blended-wing body, kind of a flying wing with internal engines, then you get about a factor three efficiency improvement at comparable or lower cost. 
Let me focus a minute on the light vehicles, the cars and light trucks, because we all know the most about those; probably everybody here drives one. 
And yet we may not realize that in a standard sedan, of all the fuel energy you feed into the car, seven-eighths never gets to the wheels; it's lost first in the engine, idling at zero miles a gallon, the power train and accessories. 
So then of the energy that does get to the wheels, only an eighth of it, half of that, goes to heat the tires on the road, or to heat the air the car pushes aside. 
And only this little bit, only six percent actually ends up accelerating the car and then heating the brakes when you stop. 
In fact, since 95 percent of the weight you're moving is the car not the driver, less than one percent of the fuel energy ends up moving the driver. 
This is not very gratifying after more than a century of devoted engineering effort. 
  Moreover, three-fourths of the fuel use is caused by the weight of the car. 
And it's obvious from the diagram that every unit of energy you save at the wheels is going to avoid wasting another seven units of energy getting that energy to the wheels. 
So there's huge leverage for making the car a lot lighter. 
And the reason this has not been very seriously examined before is there was a common assumption in the industry that -- well, then it might not be safe if you got whacked by a heavy car, and it would cost a lot more to make, because the only way we know how to make cars much lighter was to use expensive light metals like aluminum and magnesium. 
But these objections are now vanishing through advances in materials. 
For example, we use a lot of carbon-fiber composites in sporting goods. 
And it turns out that these are quite remarkable for safety. 
Here's a handmade McLaren SLR carbon car that got t-boned by a Golf. 
The Golf was totaled. 
The McLaren just popped off and scratched the side panel. 
They'll pop it back on and fix the scratch later. 
But if this McLaren were to run into a wall at 65 miles an hour, the entire crash energy would be absorbed by a couple of woven carbon-fiber composite cones, weighing a total of 15 pounds, hidden in the front end. 
Because these materials could actually absorb six to 12 times as much energy per pound as steel, and do so a lot more smoothly. 
And this means we've just cracked the conundrum of safety and weight. 
We could make cars bigger, which is protective, but make them light. 
Whereas if we made them heavy, they'd be both hostile and inefficient. 
And when you make them light in the right way, that can be simpler and cheaper to make. 
You can end up saving money, and lives, and oil, all at the same time. 
I showed here two years ago a little bit about a design of your basic, uncompromised, quintupled-efficiency suburban-assault vehicle --  -- and this is a complete virtual design that is production-costed manufacturable. 
And the process needed to make it is actually coming toward the market quite nicely. 
We figured out a kind of a digital inkjet printer for this very stiff, strong, carbon-composite material, and then ways to thermoform it, because it's a combination of carbon and nylon, into whatever complex shapes you want, like the one just shown at the auto show by one of the tier-one suppliers. 
And the manufacturing you can do this way gets radically simplified. 
Because the auto body has only, say, 14 parts, instead of 100, 150. 
Each one is formed by one fairly cheap die set, instead of four expensive ones for stamping steel. 
Each of the parts can be easily lifted with no hoist. 
They snap together like a kid's toy. 
So you got rid of the body shop. 
And if you want, you can lay color in the mold, and get rid of the paint shop. 
Those are the two hardest and costliest parts of making a car. 
So you end up with at least two-fifths lower capital intensity than the leanest plant in the industry, which GM has in Lansing. 
The plant also gets smaller. 
Now, when you go through a similar analysis for every way we use oil, including buildings, industry, feedstocks and so on, you find that of the 28 million barrels a day the government says we will need in 2025, well, about eight of that can be removed by efficiency by then, with another seven still being saved as the vehicle stocks turn over, 
at an average cost of only 12 bucks a barrel, instead of 26 for buying the oil. 
And then another six can be made robustly, competitively, from cellulosic ethanol and a little bio-diesel, without interfering at all with the water or land needs of crop production. 
There is a huge amount of gas to be saved, about half the projected gas at about an eighth of its price. 
And here are some no-brainer substitutions of it, with lots left over. 
So much, in fact, that after you've handled the domestic oil forecast from areas already approved, you have only this little bit left, and let's see how we can meet that, because there's a pretty flexible menu of ways. 
We could, of course, buy more efficiency. 
Maybe you ought to buy efficiency at 26 bucks instead of 12. 
Or wait to capture the second half of it. 
Or we could, of course, just get this little bit by continuing to import some Canadian and Mexican oil, or the ethanol the Brazilians would love to sell us. 
But they'll sell it to Japan and China instead, because we have tariff barriers to protect our corn farmers, and they don't. 
Or we could use the saved gas directly to cover all of this balance, or if we used it as hydrogen, which is more profitable and efficient, we'd get rid of the domestic oil too. 
And that doesn't even count, for example, that available land in the Dakotas can cost effectively make enough wind power to run every highway vehicle in the country. 
So we have lots of options. 
And the choice of menu and timing is quite flexible. 
Now, to make this happen quicker and with higher confidence, there is a few ways government could help. 
For example, fee-bates, a combination of a fee and a rebate in any size class of vehicle you want, can increase the price of inefficient vehicles and correspondingly pay you a rebate for efficient vehicles. 
You're not paid to change size class. 
You are paid to pick efficiency within a size class, in a way equivalent to looking at all fourteen years of life-cycle fuel savings rather than just the first two or three. 
This expands choice rapidly in the market, and actually makes more money for automakers as well. 
I'd like to deal with the lack of affordable personal mobility in this country by making it very cheaply possible for low-income families to get efficient, reliable, warranted new cars that they could otherwise never get. 
And for each car so financed, scrap almost one clunker, preferably the dirtiest ones. 
This creates a new million-car-a-year market for Detroit from customers they weren't going to get otherwise, because they weren't creditworthy and could never afford a new car. 
And Detroit will make money on every unit. 
It turns out that if, say, African-American and white households had the same car ownership, it would cut employment disparity about in half by providing better access to job opportunities. 
So this is a huge social win, too. 
Governments buy hundreds of thousands of cars a year. 
There are smart ways to buy them and to aggregate that purchasing power to bring very efficient vehicles into the market faster. 
And we could even do an X Prize-style golden carrot that's worth stretching further for. 
For example, a billion-dollar prize for the first U.S. automaker to sell 200,000 really advanced vehicles, like some you saw earlier. 
Then the legacy airlines can't afford to buy the efficient new planes they desperately need to cut their fuel bills, but if you felt philosophically you wanted to do anything about that, there are ways to finance it. 
And at the same time to scrap inefficient old planes, so that if they were otherwise to come back in the air, they would waste more oil, and block the uptake of efficient, new planes. 
Those part inefficient planes are worth more to society dead than alive. 
We ought to take them out back and shoot them, and put bounty hunters after them. 
Then there's an important military role. 
That in creating the move to high-volume, low-cost commercial production of these kinds of materials, or for that matter, ultra-light steels that are a good backup technology, the military can do the trick it did in turning DARPAnet into the Internet. 
Just turn it over to the private sector, and we have an Internet. 
The same for GPS. 
The same for the modern semi-conductor industry. 
That is, military science and technology that they need can create the advanced materials-industrial cluster that transforms its civilian economy and gets the country off oil, which would be a huge contribution to eliminating conflict over oil and advancing national and global security. 
Then we need to retool the car industry and do retraining, and shift the convergence of the energy and ag-value chains to shift faster from hydrocarbons to carbohydrates, and get out of our own way in other ways. 
And make the transition to more efficient vehicles go faster. 
But here's how the whole thing fits together. 
Instead of official forecasts of oil use and oil imports going forever up, they can turn down with the 12 dollars a barrel efficiency, down steeply by adding the supply-side substitutions at 18 bucks, all implemented at slower rates than we've done before when we paid attention. 
And if we start adding tranches of hydrogen in there, we are rapidly off imports and completely off oil in the 2040s. 
And the one thing I'd like to point out here is that we've done this before. 
In this eight-year period, 1977 to 85, when we last paid attention, the economy grew 27 percent, oil use fell 17 percent, oil imports fell 50 percent, oil imports from the Persian Gulf fell 87 percent. 
They would have been gone if we'd kept that up one more year. 
Well, that was with very old technologies and delivery methods. 
We could rerun that play a lot better now. 
And yet what we proved then is the U.S. has more market power than OPEC. 
Ours is on the demand side. 
We are the Saudi Arabia of "nega-barrels."  We can use less oil faster than they can conveniently sell less oil. 
 Whatever your reason for wanting to do this, whether you're concerned about national security or price volatility --  -- or jobs, or the planet, or your grand-kids, it seems to me that this is an oil endgame that we should all be playing to win.

<title>Cameron Sinclair: My wish: A call for open-source architecture</title> 
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Accepting his 2006 TED Prize, Cameron Sinclair demonstrates how passionate designers and architects can respond to world housing crises. He unveils his TED Prize wish for a network to improve global living standards through collaborative design.</description> 
I'm going to take you on a journey very quickly. 
To explain the wish, I'm going to have to take you somewhere where many people haven't been, and that's around the world. 
When I was about 24 years old, Kate Stohr and myself started an organization to get architects and designers involved in humanitarian work, not only about responding to natural disasters, but involved in systemic issues. 
We believe that where the resources and expertise are scarce, innovative, sustainable design can really make a difference in people's lives. 
So I started my life as an architect, or training as an architect, and I was always interested in socially responsible design, and how you can really make an impact. 
But when I went to architecture school, it seemed that I was a black sheep in the family. 
Many architects seemed to think that when you design, you design a jewel, and it's a jewel that you try and crave for; whereas I felt that when you design, you either improve or you create a detriment to the community in which you're designing. 
So you're not just doing a building for the residents or for the people who are going to use it, but for the community as a whole. 
And in 1999, we started by responding to the issue of the housing crisis for returning refugees in Kosovo. 
And I didn't know what I was doing -- like I said, mid-20s -- and I'm the Internet generation, so we started a website. 
We put a call out there, and to my surprise, in a couple of months, we had hundreds of entries from around the world. 
That led to a number of prototypes being built and really experimenting with some ideas. 
Two years later we started doing a project on developing mobile health clinics in sub-Saharan Africa, responding to the HIV/AIDS pandemic. 
That led to 550 entries from 53 countries. 
We also have designers from around the world that participate. 
And we had an exhibit of work that followed that. 
2004 was the tipping point for us. 
We started responding to natural disasters and getting involved in Iran, in Bam, also following up on our work in Africa. 
Working within the United States -- most people look at poverty and they see the face of a foreigner. 
But I live in Bozeman, Montana -- go up to the north plains on the reservations, or go down to Alabama or Mississippi, pre-Katrina, and I could have shown you places that have far worse conditions than many developing countries that I've been to. 
So we got involved in and worked in inner cities and elsewhere; and also, I will go into some more projects. 
2005: Mother Nature kicked our ass. 
I think we can pretty much assume that 2005 was a horrific year when it comes to natural disasters. 
And because of the Internet, and because of connections to blogs and so forth, within literally hours of the tsunami, we were already raising funds, getting involved, working with people on the ground. 
We run from a couple of laptops, and in the first couple of days, I had 4,000 emails from people needing help. 
So we began to get involved in projects there, and I'll talk about some others. 
And then of course, this year we've been responding to Katrina, as well as following up on our reconstruction work. 
So this is a brief overview. 
In 2004, I really couldn't manage the number of people who wanted to help, or the number of requests that I was getting. 
It was all coming into my laptop and cell phone. 
So we decided to embrace an open-source model of business -- so that anyone, anywhere in the world, could start a local chapter, and they can get involved in local problems. 
Because I believe there is no such thing as Utopia. 
All problems are local. All solutions are local. 
So that means, you know, somebody who's based in Mississippi knows more about Mississippi than I do. 
So what happened is, we used Meetup and all these other Internet tools, and we ended up having 40 chapters starting up, thousands of architects in 104 countries. 
So the bullet point -- sorry, I never do a suit, so I knew that I was going to take this off. 
OK, because I'm going to do it very quick. 
This isn't just about nonprofit. 
What it showed me is that there's a grassroots movement going on, of socially responsible designers who really believe that this world has got a lot smaller, and that we have the opportunity -- not the responsibility, but the opportunity -- to really get involved in making change. 
 I'm adding that to my time. 
So what you don't know is, we've got these thousands of designers working around the world, connected basically by a website, and we have a staff of three. 
The fact that nobody told us we couldn't do it, we did it. 
And so there's something to be said about naïveté. So seven years later, we've developed so that we've got advocacy, instigation and implementation. 
We advocate for good design, not only through student workshops and lectures and public forums, op-eds; we have a book on humanitarian work; but also disaster mitigation and dealing with public policy. 
We can talk about FEMA, but that's another talk. 
Instigation, developing ideas with communities and NGOs, doing open-source design competitions. 
Referring, matchmaking with communities. 
And then implementing -- actually going out there and doing the work, because when you invent, it's never a reality until it's built. 
So it's really important that if we're designing and trying to create change, we build that change. 
So here's a select number of projects. 
Kosovo. This is Kosovo in '99. 
We did an open design competition, like I said. 
It led to a whole variety of ideas. And this wasn't about emergency shelter, but transitional shelter that would last five to 10 years, that would be placed next to the land the resident lived in, and that they would rebuild their own home. 
This wasn't imposing an architecture on a community; this was giving them the tools and the space to allow them to rebuild and regrow the way they want to. 
We had from the sublime to the ridiculous, but they worked. 
This is an inflatable hemp house. It was built; it works. 
This is a shipping container. Built and works. 
And a whole variety of ideas that not only dealt with architectural building, but also the issues of governance, and the idea of creating communities through complex networks. 
So we've engaged not just designers, but also a whole variety of technology-based professionals. 
Using rubble from destroyed homes to create new homes. 
Using straw bale construction, creating heat walls. 
And then something remarkable happened in '99. 
We went to Africa originally to look at the housing issue. 
Within three days, we realized the problem was not housing; it was the growing pandemic of HIV/AIDS. 
And it wasn't doctors telling us this; it was actual villagers that we were staying with. 
And so we came up with the bright idea that instead of getting people to walk 10, 15 kilometers to see doctors, And we started engaging the medical community, and you know, we thought we were real bright sparks -- "We've come up with this great idea: mobile health clinics, widely distributed throughout sub-Saharan Africa." 
And the medical community there said, "We've said this for the last decade. 
We know this. We just don't know how to show this." 
So in a way, we had taken pre-existing needs and shown solutions. 
And so again, we had a whole variety of ideas that came in. 
This one I personally love, because the idea is that architecture is not just about solutions, but about raising awareness. 
This is a kenaf clinic. You get seed and you grow it in a plot of land, and it grows 14 feet in a month. 
And on the fourth week, the doctors come and they mow out an area, put a tensile structure on the top, and when the doctors have finished treating and seeing patients and villagers, you cut down the clinic and you eat it. 
So it's dealing with the fact that if you have AIDS, you also need to have nutrition rates, and the idea of nutrition is as important as getting antiretrovirals out there. 
This one I love. 
The idea is it's not just a clinic, it's a community center. 
This looked at setting up trade routes and economic engines within the community, so it can be a self-sustaining project. 
Every one of these projects is sustainable. 
That's not because I'm a tree-hugging green person. 
It's because when you live on four dollars a day, you're living on survival and you have to be sustainable. 
You have to know where your energy is coming from, you have to know where your resource is coming from, and you have to keep the maintenance down. 
So this is about getting an economic engine, and then at night, it turns into a movie theater. 
So it's not an AIDS clinic. It's a community center. 
So you can see ideas. And these ideas developed into prototypes, and they were eventually built. And currently, as of this year, there are clinics rolling out in Nigeria and Kenya. 
From that, we also developed Siyathemba. 
The community came to us and said, "The problem is that the girls don't have education." 
And we're working in an area where young women between the ages of 16 and 24 have a 50 percent HIV/AIDS rate. 
And that's not because they're promiscuous, it's because there's no knowledge. 
And so we decided to look at the idea of sports, and create a youth sports center that doubled as an HIV/AIDS outreach center, and the coaches of the girls' team were also trained doctors. 
So that there would be a very slow way of developing confidence in health care. 
And we picked nine finalists, and then those nine finalists were distributed throughout the entire region, and then the community picked their design. 
They said, this is our design, because it's not only about engaging a community; it's about empowering a community, and about getting them to be a part of the rebuilding process. 
So, the winning design is here. 
He's out there working with the first ever women's soccer team in KwaZulu-Natal, Siyathemba. 
And they can tell it better. 
(A cappella singing in a South African language) Video: Well, my name is Cee Cee Mkhonza. 
I work at the Africa Centre, I'm an IT user consultant. 
I'm also the national football player for South Africa, Banyana Banyana. 
And I also play in the Vodacom League, for the team called Tembisa, which has now changed to Siyathemba. 
This is our home ground. 
Cameron Sinclair: I'm going to show that later because I'm running out of time. 
I can see Chris looking at me slyly. 
This was a connection, just a meeting with somebody who wanted to develop Africa's first telemedicine center, in Tanzania. 
And we met, literally, a couple of months ago. We've already developed a design. 
The team is over there, working in partnership. 
This was a matchmaking, thanks to a couple of TEDsters -- Sun [Microsystems], Cheryl Heller and Andrew Zolli, who connected me with this amazing African woman. 
And we start construction in June, and it will be opened by TEDGlobal. 
So when you come to TEDGlobal, you can check it out. 
But what we're known probably most for is dealing with disasters and development, and we've been involved in a lot of issues, such as the tsunami and also things like Hurricane Katrina. 
This is a 370-dollar shelter that can be easily assembled. 
This is a community-designed community center. 
And what that means is we actually live and work with the community, and they're part of the design process. 
The kids actually get involved in mapping out where the community center should be. 
And then eventually, the community, through skills training, end up building the building with us. 
Here is another school. 
This is what the UN gave these guys for six months -- 12 plastic tarps. 
This was in August. 
This was the replacement; that's supposed to last for two years. 
When the rain comes down, you can't hear a thing, and in the summer, it's about 140 degrees inside. 
So we said, if the rain's coming down, let's get fresh water. 
So every one of our schools has a rainwater collection system. 
Very low cost: three classrooms and rainwater collection is 5,000 dollars. 
This was raised by hot chocolate sales in Atlanta. 
It's built by the parents of the kids. 
The kids are out there on-site, building the buildings. 
And it opened a couple of weeks ago, and there's 600 kids that are now using the schools. 
 So, disaster hits home. 
We see the bad stories on CNN and Fox and all that, but we don't see the good stories. 
Here is a community that got together, and they said "no" to waiting. 
They formed a partnership, a diverse partnership of players, to actually map out East Biloxi, to figure out who's getting involved. 
We've had over 1,500 volunteers rebuilding, rehabbing homes. 
Figuring out what FEMA regulations are, not waiting for them to dictate to us how you should rebuild. 
Working with residents, getting them out of their homes, so they don't get ill. 
This is what they're cleaning up on their own. 
Designing housing. This house is going in in a couple of weeks. 
This is a rehabbed home, done in four days. 
This is a utility room for a woman who is on a walker. 
She's 70 years old. This is what FEMA gave her. 
600 bucks, happened two days ago. 
We put together, very quickly, a washroom. 
It's built, it's running and she just started a business today, where she's washing other people's clothes. 
These are the Calhouns. 
They're photographers who had documented the Lower Ninth for the last 40 years. 
That was their home, and these are the photographs they took. 
And we're helping, working with them to create a new building. 
Projects we've been a part of, support. 
Why don't aid agencies do this? This is the UN tent. 
This is the new UN tent, just introduced this year. 
It's got a flap -- that's the invention. 
It took 20 years to design this and get it implemented in the field. 
I was 12 years old. There's a problem here. 
Luckily, we're not alone. 
There are hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of architects and designers and inventors around the world that are getting involved in humanitarian work. 
More hemp houses -- it's a theme in Japan, apparently. 
I'm not sure what they're smoking. 
This is a Grip Clip, designed by somebody who said, "All you need is some way to attach membrane structures to physical support beams." 
This guy designed for NASA, is now doing housing. 
I'm going to whip through this quickly, because I know I've got only a couple of minutes. 
So this is all done in the last two years. 
I showed you something that took 20 years to do. 
And this is just a selection of things that were built in the last couple of years. 
From Brazil to India, Mexico, Alabama, China, Israel, Palestine, Vietnam. 
The average age of a designer who gets involved in this project is 32 -- I just have to stop here, because Arup is in the room, and this is the best-designed toilet in the world. 
If you're ever, ever in India, go use this toilet. 
 Chris Luebkeman will tell you why. 
I'm sure that's how he wanted to spend the party. 
But the future is not going to be the sky-scraping cities of New York, but this. And when you look at this, you see crisis. 
What I see is many, many inventors. 
One billion people live in abject poverty. 
We hear about them all the time. 
Four billion live in growing but fragile economies. 
One in seven live in unplanned settlements. 
If we do nothing about the housing crisis that's about to happen, in 20 years, one in three people will live in an unplanned settlement or a refugee camp. Look left, look right: one of you will be there. 
How do we improve the living standards of five billion people? 
With 10 million solutions. 
So I wish to develop a community that actively embraces innovative and sustainable design to improve the living conditions for everyone. 
Chris Anderson: Wait a sec -- that's your wish? 
CS: That's my wish. 
CA: That's his wish! 
 CS: We started Architecture for Humanity with 700 dollars and a website. 
So Chris somehow decided to give me 100,000. 
So why not this many people? 
Open-source architecture is the way to go. 
You have a diverse community of participants -- and we're not just talking about inventors and designers, but we're talking about the funding model. 
My role is not as a designer; it's as a conduit between the design world and the humanitarian world. 
And what we need is something that replicates me globally, because I haven't slept in seven years. 
 Secondly, what will this thing be? 
Designers want to respond to issues of humanitarian crisis, but they don't want some company in the West taking their idea and basically profiting from it. 
So Creative Commons has developed the Developing Nations license. 
And what that means is that a designer can -- The Siyathemba project I showed was the first ever building to have a Creative Commons license on it. 
As soon as that is built, anyone in Africa or any developing nation can take the construction documents and replicate it for free. 
 So why not allow designers the opportunity to do this, but still protect their rights here? 
We want to have a community where you can upload ideas, and those ideas can be tested in an earthquake, in flood, in all sorts of austere environments. The reason that's important is I don't want to wait for the next Katrina to find out if my house works. That's too late, we need to do it now. 
So doing that globally -- and I want this whole thing to work multi-lingually. 
When you look at the face of an architect, most people think a gray-haired white guy. 
I don't see that; I see the face of the world. 
So I want everyone from all over the planet to be able to be a part of this design and development. 
The idea of needs-based competitions -- XPRIZE for the other 98 percent, if you want to call it that. 
We also want to look at ways of matchmaking and putting funding partners together, and the idea of integrating manufacturers -- fab labs in every country. 
When I hear about the $100 laptop and it's going to educate every child -- educate every designer in the world. 
Put one in every favela, every slum settlement. Because you know what? Innovation will happen. 
And I need to know that. It's called the leap-back. 
We talk about leapfrog technologies. 
I write with Worldchanging, and the one thing we've been talking about is, I learn more on the ground than I've ever learned here. 
So let's take those ideas, adapt them, and we can use them. 
These ideas are supposed to be adaptable; they should have the potential for evolution; they should be developed by every nation in the world and useful for every nation in the world. What will it take? 
There should be a sheet. I don't have time to read this, because I'm going to be yanked off. 
CA: Let's just leave it up for a sec. 
CS: Well, what will it take? You guys are smart. 
So it's going to take a lot of computing power, because I want the idea that any laptop anywhere in the world can plug into the system and be able to not only participate in developing these designs, but utilize the designs. Also, a process of reviewing the designs. 
I want every Arup engineer in the world to check and make sure that we're doing stuff that's standing, because those guys are the best in the world. 
And so, you know, I want these -- I just should note: I have two laptops and one of them is there, and that has 3000 designs on it. If I drop that laptop ... What happens? 
So it's important to have these proven ideas put up there, easy to use, easy to get ahold of. 
My mom once said, "There's nothing worse than being all mouth and no trousers." 
 I'm fed up of talking about making change. 
You only make it by doing it. 
We've changed FEMA guidelines; we've changed public policy; we've changed international response -- based on building things. 
So for me, it's important that we create a real conduit for innovation, and that it's free innovation. 
Think of free culture -- this is free innovation. 
Somebody said this a couple of years back. 
I will give points for those who know it. 
But I think the man was maybe 25 years too early. So let's do it. 
Thank you.

<title>Steven Johnson: How the "ghost map" helped end a killer disease</title> 
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Author Steven Johnson takes us on a 10-minute tour of The Ghost Map, his book about a cholera outbreak in 1854 London and the impact it had on science, cities and modern society.</description> 
If you haven't ordered yet, I generally find the rigatoni with the spicy tomato sauce goes best with diseases of the small intestine. 
 So, sorry -- it just feels like I should be doing stand-up up here because of the setting. 
No, what I want to do is take you back to 1854 in London for the next few minutes, and tell the story -- in brief -- of this outbreak, which in many ways, I think, helped create the world that we live in today, and particularly the kind of city that we live in today. 
This period in 1854, in the middle part of the 19th century, in London's history, is incredibly interesting for a number of reasons. 
But I think the most important one is that London was this city of 2.5 million people, and it was the largest city on the face of the planet at that point. 
But it was also the largest city that had ever been built. 
And so the Victorians were trying to live through and simultaneously invent a whole new scale of living: this scale of living that we, you know, now call "metropolitan living." 
And it was in many ways, at this point in the mid-1850s, a complete disaster. 
They were basically a city living with a modern kind of industrial metropolis with an Elizabethan public infrastructure. 
So people, for instance, just to gross you out for a second, had cesspools of human waste in their basement. Like, a foot to two feet deep. 
And they would just kind of throw the buckets down there and hope that it would somehow go away, and of course it never really would go away. 
And all of this stuff, basically, had accumulated to the point where the city was incredibly offensive to just walk around in. 
It was an amazingly smelly city. Not just because of the cesspools, but also the sheer number of livestock in the city would shock people. 
Not just the horses, but people had cows in their attics that they would use for milk, that they would hoist up there and keep them in the attic until literally their milk ran out and they died, and then they would drag them off to the bone boilers down the street. 
So, you would just walk around London at this point and just be overwhelmed with this stench. 
And what ended up happening is that an entire emerging public health system became convinced that it was the smell that was killing everybody, that was creating these diseases that would wipe through the city every three or four years. 
And cholera was really the great killer of this period. 
It arrived in London in 1832, and every four or five years another epidemic would take 10,000, 20,000 people in London and throughout the U.K. 
And so the authorities became convinced that this smell was this problem. 
We had to get rid of the smell. 
And so, in fact, they concocted a couple of early, you know, founding public-health interventions in the system of the city, one of which was called the "Nuisances Act," which they got everybody as far as they could to empty out their cesspools and just pour all that waste into the river. 
Because if we get it out of the streets, it'll smell much better, and -- oh right, we drink from the river. 
So what ended up happening, actually, is they ended up increasing the outbreaks of cholera because, as we now know, cholera is actually in the water. 
It's a waterborne disease, not something that's in the air. 
It's not something you smell or inhale; it's something you ingest. 
And so one of the founding moments of public health in the 19th century effectively poisoned the water supply of London much more effectively than any modern day bioterrorist could have ever dreamed of doing. 
So this was the state of London in 1854, and in the middle of all this carnage and offensive conditions, and in the midst of all this scientific confusion about what was actually killing people, it was a very talented classic 19th century multi-disciplinarian named John Snow, who was a local doctor in Soho in London, who had been arguing for about four or five years 
that cholera was, in fact, a waterborne disease, and had basically convinced nobody of this. 
The public health authorities had largely ignored what he had to say. 
And he'd made the case in a number of papers and done a number of studies, but nothing had really stuck. 
And part of -- what's so interesting about this story to me is that in some ways, it's a great case study in how cultural change happens, how a good idea eventually comes to win out over much worse ideas. 
And Snow labored for a long time with this great insight that everybody ignored. 
And then on one day, August 28th of 1854, a young child, a five-month-old girl whose first name we don't know, we know her only as Baby Lewis, somehow contracted cholera, came down with cholera at 40 Broad Street. 
You can't really see it in this map, but this is the map that becomes the central focus in the second half of my book. 
It's in the middle of Soho, in this working class neighborhood, this little girl becomes sick and it turns out that the cesspool, that they still continue to have, despite the Nuisances Act, bordered on an extremely popular water pump, local watering hole that was well known for the best water in all of Soho, that all the residents from Soho and the surrounding neighborhoods would go to. 
And so this little girl inadvertently ended up contaminating the water in this popular pump, and one of the most terrifying outbreaks in the history of England erupted about two or three days later. 
Literally, 10 percent of the neighborhood died in seven days, and much more would have died if people hadn't fled after the initial outbreak kicked in. 
So it was this incredibly terrifying event. 
You had these scenes of entire families dying over the course of 48 hours of cholera, alone in their one-room apartments, in their little flats. 
Just an extraordinary, terrifying scene. 
Snow lived near there, heard about the outbreak, and in this amazing act of courage went directly into the belly of the beast because he thought an outbreak that concentrated could actually potentially end up convincing people that, in fact, the real menace of cholera was in the water supply and not in the air. 
He suspected an outbreak that concentrated would probably involve a single point source. 
One single thing that everybody was going to because it didn't have the traditional slower path of infections that you might expect. 
And so he went right in there and started interviewing people. 
He eventually enlisted the help of this amazing other figure, who's kind of the other protagonist of the book -- this guy, Henry Whitehead, who was a local minister, who was not at all a man of science, but was incredibly socially connected; he knew everybody in the neighborhood. 
And he managed to track down, Whitehead did, many of the cases of people who had drunk water from the pump, or who hadn't drunk water from the pump. 
And eventually Snow made a map of the outbreak. 
He found increasingly that people who drank from the pump were getting sick. 
People who hadn't drunk from the pump were not getting sick. 
And he thought about representing that as a kind of a table of statistics of people living in different neighborhoods, people who hadn't, you know, percentages of people who hadn't, but eventually he hit upon the idea that what he needed was something that you could see. 
Something that would take in a sense a higher-level view of all this activity that had been happening in the neighborhood. 
And so he created this map, which basically ended up representing all the deaths in the neighborhoods as black bars at each address. 
And you can see in this map, the pump right at the center of it and you can see that one of the residences down the way had about 15 people dead. 
And the map is actually a little bit bigger. 
As you get further and further away from the pump, the deaths begin to grow less and less frequent. 
And so you can see this something poisonous emanating out of this pump that you could see in a glance. 
And so, with the help of this map, and with the help of more evangelizing that he did over the next few years and that Whitehead did, eventually, actually, the authorities slowly started to come around. 
It took much longer than sometimes we like to think in this story, but by 1866, when the next big cholera outbreak came to London, the authorities had been convinced -- in part because of this story, in part because of this map -- that in fact the water was the problem. 
And they had already started building the sewers in London, and they immediately went to this outbreak and they told everybody to start boiling their water. 
And that was the last time that London has seen a cholera outbreak since. 
So, part of this story, I think -- well, it's a terrifying story, it's a very dark story and it's a story that continues on in many of the developing cities of the world. 
It's also a story really that is fundamentally optimistic, which is to say that it's possible to solve these problems if we listen to reason, if we listen to the kind of wisdom of these kinds of maps, if we listen to people like Snow and Whitehead, if we listen to the locals who understand what's going on in these kinds of situations. 
And what it ended up doing is making the idea of large-scale metropolitan living a sustainable one. 
When people were looking at 10 percent of their neighborhoods dying in the space of seven days, there was a widespread consensus that this couldn't go on, that people weren't meant to live in cities of 2.5 million people. 
But because of what Snow did, because of this map, because of the whole series of reforms that happened in the wake of this map, we now take for granted that cities have 10 million people, cities like this one are in fact sustainable things. 
We don't worry that New York City is going to collapse in on itself quite the way that, you know, Rome did, and be 10 percent of its size in 100 years or 200 years. 
And so that in a way is the ultimate legacy of this map. 
It's a map of deaths that ended up creating a whole new way of life, the life that we're enjoying here today. Thank you very much.

<title>Bjorn Lomborg: Global priorities bigger than climate change</title> 
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Given $50 billion to spend, which would you solve first, AIDS or global warming? Danish political scientist Bjorn Lomborg comes up with surprising answers.</description> 
What I'd like to talk about is really the biggest problems in the world. 
I'm not going to talk about "The Skeptical Environmentalist" -- probably that's also a good choice. 
 But I am going talk about: what are the big problems in the world? 
And I must say, before I go on, I should ask every one of you to try and get out pen and paper because I'm actually going to ask you to help me to look at how we do that. 
So get out your pen and paper. 
Bottom line is, there is a lot of problems out there in the world. 
I'm just going to list some of them. 
There are 800 million people starving. 
There's a billion people without clean drinking water. 
Two billion people without sanitation. 
There are several million people dying of HIV and AIDS. 
The lists go on and on. 
There's two billions of people who will be severely affected by climate change -- so on. 
There are many, many problems out there. 
In an ideal world, we would solve them all, but we don't. 
We don't actually solve all problems. 
And if we do not, the question I think we need to ask ourselves -- and that's why it's on the economy session -- is to say, if we don't do all things, we really have to start asking ourselves, which ones should we solve first? 
And that's the question I'd like to ask you. 
If we had say, 50 billion dollars over the next four years to spend to do good in this world, where should we spend it? 
We identified 10 of the biggest challenges in the world, and I will just briefly read them: climate change, communicable diseases, conflicts, education, financial instability, governance and corruption, malnutrition and hunger, population migration, sanitation and water, and subsidies and trade barriers. 
We believe that these in many ways encompass the biggest problems in the world. 
The obvious question would be to ask, what do you think are the biggest things? 
Where should we start on solving these problems? 
But that's a wrong problem to ask. 
That was actually the problem that was asked in Davos in January. 
But of course, there's a problem in asking people to focus on problems. 
Because we can't solve problems. 
Surely the biggest problem we have in the world is that we all die. 
But we don't have a technology to solve that, right? 
So the point is not to prioritize problems, but the point is to prioritize solutions to problems. 
And that would be -- of course that gets a little more complicated. 
To climate change that would be like Kyoto. 
To communicable diseases, it might be health clinics or mosquito nets. 
To conflicts, it would be U.N.'s peacekeeping forces, and so on. 
The point that I would like to ask you to try to do, is just in 30 seconds -- and I know this is in a sense an impossible task -- write down what you think is probably some of the top priorities. 
And also -- and that's, of course, where economics gets evil -- to put down what are the things we should not do, first. 
What should be at the bottom of the list? 
Please, just take 30 seconds, perhaps talk to your neighbor, and just figure out what should be the top priorities and the bottom priorities of the solutions that we have to the world's biggest issues. 
The amazing part of this process -- and of course, I mean, I would love to -- I only have 18 minutes, I've already given you quite a substantial amount of my time, right? 
I'd love to go into, and get you to think about this process, and that's actually what we did. 
And I also strongly encourage you, and I'm sure we'll also have these discussions afterwards, to think about, how do we actually prioritize? 
Of course, you have to ask yourself, why on Earth was such a list never done before? 
And one reason is that prioritization is incredibly uncomfortable. 
Nobody wants to do this. 
Of course, every organization would love to be on the top of such a list. 
But every organization would also hate to be not on the top of the list. 
And since there are many more not-number-one spots on the list than there is number ones, it makes perfect sense not to want to do such a list. 
We've had the U.N. for almost 60 years, yet we've never actually made a fundamental list of all the big things that we can do in the world, and said, which of them should we do first? 
So it doesn't mean that we are not prioritizing -- any decision is a prioritization, so of course we are still prioritizing, if only implicitly -- and that's unlikely to be as good as if we actually did the prioritization, and went in and talked about it. 
So what I'm proposing is really to say that we have, for a very long time, had a situation when we've had a menu of choices. 
There are many, many things we can do out there, but we've not had the prices, nor the sizes. 
We have not had an idea. 
Imagine going into a restaurant and getting this big menu card, but you have no idea what the price is. 
You know, you have a pizza; you've no idea what the price is. 
It could be at one dollar; it could be 1,000 dollars. 
It could be a family-size pizza; it could be a very individual-size pizza, right? 
We'd like to know these things. 
And that is what the Copenhagen Consensus is really trying to do -- to try to put prices on these issues. 
And so basically, this has been the Copenhagen Consensus' process. 
We got 30 of the world's best economists, three in each area. 
So we have three of world's top economists write about climate change. 
What can we do? What will be the cost and what will be the benefit of that? 
Likewise in communicable diseases. 
Three of the world's top experts saying, what can we do? 
What would be the price? 
What should we do about it, and what will be the outcome? 
And so on. 
Then we had some of the world's top economists, eight of the world's top economists, including three Nobel Laureates, meet in Copenhagen in May 2004. 
We called them the "dream team." 
The Cambridge University prefects decided to call them the Real Madrid of economics. 
That works very well in Europe, but it doesn't really work over here. 
And what they basically did was come out with a prioritized list. 
And then you ask, why economists? 
And of course, I'm very happy you asked that question --  -- because that's a very good question. 
The point is, of course, if you want to know about malaria, you ask a malaria expert. 
If you want to know about climate, you ask a climatologist. 
But if you want to know which of the two you should deal with first, you can't ask either of them, because that's not what they do. 
That is what economists do. 
They prioritize. 
They make that in some ways disgusting task of saying, which one should we do first, and which one should we do afterwards? 
So this is the list, and this is the one I'd like to share with you. 
Of course, you can also see it on the website, and we'll also talk about it more, I'm sure, as the day goes on. 
They basically came up with a list where they said there were bad projects -- basically, projects where if you invest a dollar, you get less than a dollar back. 
Then there's fair projects, good projects and very good projects. 
And of course, it's the very good projects we should start doing. 
I'm going to go from backwards so that we end up with the best projects. 
These were the bad projects. 
As you might see the bottom of the list was climate change. 
This offends a lot of people, and that's probably one of the things where people will say I shouldn't come back, either. 
And I'd like to talk about that, because that's really curious. 
Why is it it came up? 
And I'll actually also try to get back to this because it's probably one of the things that we'll disagree with on the list that you wrote down. 
The reason why they came up with saying that Kyoto -- or doing something more than Kyoto -- is a bad deal is simply because it's very inefficient. 
It's not saying that global warming is not happening. 
It's not saying that it's not a big problem. 
But it's saying that what we can do about it is very little, at a very high cost. 
What they basically show us, the average of all macroeconomic models, is that Kyoto, if everyone agreed, would cost about 150 billion dollars a year. 
That's a substantial amount of money. 
That's two to three times the global development aid that we give the Third World every year. 
Yet it would do very little good. 
All models show it will postpone warming for about six years in 2100. 
So the guy in Bangladesh who gets a flood in 2100 can wait until 2106. 
Which is a little good, but not very much good. 
So the idea here really is to say, well, we've spent a lot of money doing a little good. 
And just to give you a sense of reference, the U.N. actually estimate that for half that amount, for about 75 billion dollars a year, we could solve all major basic problems in the world. 
We could give clean drinking water, sanitation, basic healthcare and education to every single human being on the planet. 
So we have to ask ourselves, do we want to spend twice the amount on doing very little good? 
Or half the amount on doing an amazing amount of good? 
And that is really why it becomes a bad project. 
It's not to say that if we had all the money in the world, we wouldn't want to do it. 
But it's to say, when we don't, it's just simply not our first priority. 
The fair projects -- notice I'm not going to comment on all these -- but communicable diseases, scale of basic health services -- just made it, simply because, yes, scale of basic health services is a great thing. 
It would do a lot of good, but it's also very, very costly. 
Again, what it tells us is suddenly we start thinking about both sides of the equation. 
If you look at the good projects, a lot of sanitation and water projects came in. 
Again, sanitation and water is incredibly important, but it also costs a lot of infrastructure. 
So I'd like to show you the top four priorities which should be at least the first ones that we deal with when we talk about how we should deal with the problems in the world. 
The fourth best problem is malaria -- dealing with malaria. 
The incidence of malaria is about a couple of [million] people get infected every year. 
It might even cost up towards a percentage point of GDP every year for affected nations. 
If we invested about 13 billion dollars over the next four years, we could bring that incidence down to half. 
We could avoid about 500,000 people dying, but perhaps more importantly, we could avoid about a [million] people getting infected every year. 
We would significantly increase their ability to deal with many of the other problems that they have to deal with -- of course, in the long run, also to deal with global warming. 
This third best one was free trade. 
Basically, the model showed that if we could get free trade, and especially cut subsidies in the U.S. and Europe, we could basically enliven the global economy to an astounding number of about 2,400 billion dollars a year, half of which would accrue to the Third World. 
Again, the point is to say that we could actually pull two to three hundred million people out of poverty, very radically fast, in about two to five years. 
That would be the third best thing we could do. 
The second best thing would be to focus on malnutrition. 
Not just malnutrition in general, but there's a very cheap way of dealing with malnutrition, namely, the lack of micronutrients. 
Basically, about half of the world's population is lacking in iron, zinc, iodine and vitamin A. 
If we invest about 12 billion dollars, we could make a severe inroad into that problem. 
That would be the second best investment that we could do. 
And the very best project would be to focus on HIV/AIDS. 
Basically, if we invest 27 billion dollars over the next eight years, we could avoid 28 new million cases of HIV/AIDS. 
Again, what this does and what it focuses on is saying there are two very different ways that we can deal with HIV/AIDS. 
One is treatment; the other one is prevention. 
And again, in an ideal world, we would do both. 
But in a world where we don't do either, or don't do it very well, we have to at least ask ourselves where should we invest first. 
And treatment is much, much more expensive than prevention. 
So basically, what this focuses on is saying, we can do a lot more by investing in prevention. 
Basically for the amount of money that we spend, we can do X amount of good in treatment, and 10 times as much good in prevention. 
So again, what we focus on is prevention rather than treatment, at first rate. 
What this really does is that it makes us think about our priorities. 
I'd like to have you look at your priority list and say, did you get it right? 
Or did you get close to what we came up with here? 
Well, of course, one of the things is climate change again. 
I find a lot of people find it very, very unlikely that we should do that. 
We should also do climate change, if for no other reason, simply because it's such a big problem. 
But of course, we don't do all problems. 
There are many problems out there in the world. 
And what I want to make sure of is, if we actually focus on problems, that we focus on the right ones. 
The ones where we can do a lot of good rather than a little good. 
And I think, actually -- Thomas Schelling, one of the participants in the dream team, he put it very, very well. 
One of things that people forget, is that in 100 years, when we're talking about most of the climate change impacts will be, people will be much, much richer. 
Even the most pessimistic impact scenarios of the U.N. 
estimate that the average person in the developing world in 2100 will be about as rich as we are today. 
Much more likely, they will be two to four times richer than we are. 
And of course, we'll be even richer than that. 
But the point is to say, when we talk about saving people, or helping people in Bangladesh in 2100, we're not talking about a poor Bangladeshi. 
We're actually talking about a fairly rich Dutch guy. 
And so the real point, of course, is to say, do we want to spend a lot of money helping a little, 100 years from now, a fairly rich Dutch guy? 
Or do we want to help real poor people, right now, in Bangladesh, who really need the help, and whom we can help very, very cheaply? 
Or as Schelling put it, imagine if you were a rich -- as you will be -- a rich Chinese, a rich Bolivian, a rich Congolese, in 2100, thinking back on 2005, and saying, "How odd that they cared so much about helping me a little bit through climate change, and cared so fairly little about helping my grandfather and my great grandfather, whom they could have helped so much more, 
and who needed the help so much more?" 
So I think that really does tell us why it is we need to get our priorities straight. 
Even if it doesn't accord to the typical way we see this problem. 
Of course, that's mainly because climate change has good pictures. 
We have, you know, "The Day After Tomorrow" -- it looks great, right? 
It's a good film in the sense that I certainly want to see it, right, but don't expect Emmerich to cast Brad Pitt in his next movie digging latrines in Tanzania or something.  It just doesn't make for as much of a movie. 
So in many ways, I think of the Copenhagen Consensus and the whole discussion of priorities as a defense for boring problems. 
To make sure that we realize it's not about making us feel good. 
It's not about making things that have the most media attention, but it's about making places where we can actually do the most good. 
The other objections, I think, that are important to say, is that I'm somehow -- or we are somehow -- positing a false choice. 
Of course, we should do all things, in an ideal world -- I would certainly agree. 
I think we should do all things, but we don't. 
In 1970, the developed world decided we were going to spend twice as much as we did, right now, than in 1970, on the developing world. 
Since then our aid has halved. 
So it doesn't look like we're actually on the path of suddenly solving all big problems. 
Likewise, people are also saying, but what about the Iraq war? 
You know, we spend 100 billion dollars -- why don't we spend that on doing good in the world? 
I'm all for that. 
If any one of you guys can talk Bush into doing that, that's fine. 
But the point, of course, is still to say, if you get another 100 billion dollars, we still want to spend that in the best possible way, don't we? 
So the real issue here is to get ourselves back and think about what are the right priorities. 
I should just mention briefly, is this really the right list that we got out? 
You know, when you ask the world's best economists, you inevitably end up asking old, white American men. 
And they're not necessarily, you know, great ways of looking at the entire world. 
So we actually invited 80 young people from all over the world to come and solve the same problem. 
The only two requirements were that they were studying at the university, and they spoke English. 
The majority of them were, first, from developing countries. 
They had all the same material but they could go vastly outside the scope of discussion, and they certainly did, to come up with their own lists. 
And the surprising thing was that the list was very similar -- with malnutrition and diseases at the top and climate change at the bottom. 
We've done this many other times. 
There's been many other seminars and university students, and different things. 
They all come out with very much the same list. 
And that gives me great hope, really, in saying that I do believe that there is a path ahead to get us to start thinking about priorities, and saying, what is the important thing in the world? 
Of course, in an ideal world, again we'd love to do everything. 
But if we don't do it, then we can start thinking about where should we start? 
I see the Copenhagen Consensus as a process. 
We did it in 2004, and we hope to assemble many more people, getting much better information for 2008, 2012. 
Map out the right path for the world -- but also to start thinking about political triage. 
To start thinking about saying, "Let's do not the things where we can do very little at a very high cost, not the things that we don't know how to do, but let's do the great things where we can do an enormous amount of good, at very low cost, right now." 
At the end of the day, you can disagree with the discussion of how we actually prioritize these, but we have to be honest and frank about saying, if there's some things we do, there are other things we don't do. 
If we worry too much about some things, we end by not worrying about other things. 
So I hope this will help us make better priorities, and think about how we better work for the world. 
Thank you.

<title>Charles Leadbeater: The era of open innovation</title> 
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: In this deceptively casual talk, Charles Leadbeater weaves a tight argument that innovation isn't just for professionals anymore. Passionate amateurs, using new tools, are creating products and paradigms that companies can't.</description> 
What I'm going to do, in the spirit of collaborative creativity, is simply repeat many of the points that the three people before me have already made, but do them -- this is called "creative collaboration;" it's actually called "borrowing" -- but do it through a particular perspective, and that is to ask about the role of users and consumers in this emerging world of 
collaborative creativity that Jimmy and others have talked about. 
Let me just ask you, to start with, this simple question: who invented the mountain bike? 
Because traditional economic theory would say, well, the mountain bike was probably invented by some big bike corporation that had a big R&amp;D lab where they were thinking up new projects, and it came out of there. It didn't come from there. 
Another answer might be, well, it came from a sort of lone genius working in his garage, who, working away on different kinds of bikes, comes up with a bike out of thin air. 
It didn't come from there. The mountain bike came from users, came from young users, particularly a group in Northern California, who were frustrated with traditional racing bikes, which were those sort of bikes that Eddy Merckx rode, or your big brother, and they're very glamorous. 
But also frustrated with the bikes that your dad rode, which sort of had big handlebars like that, and they were too heavy. 
So, they got the frames from these big bikes, put them together with the gears from the racing bikes, got the brakes from motorcycles, and sort of mixed and matched various ingredients. 
And for the first, I don't know, three to five years of their life, mountain bikes were known as "clunkers." 
And they were just made in a community of bikers, mainly in Northern California. 
And then one of these companies that was importing parts for the clunkers decided to set up in business, start selling them to other people, and gradually another company emerged out of that, Marin, and it probably was, I don't know, 10, maybe even 15, years, before the big bike companies realized there was a market. 
Thirty years later, mountain bike sales and mountain bike equipment account for 65 percent of bike sales in America. 
That's 58 billion dollars. 
This is a category entirely created by consumers that would not have been created by the mainstream bike market because they couldn't see the need, the opportunity; they didn't have the incentive to innovate. 
The one thing I think I disagree with about Yochai's presentation is when he said the Internet causes this distributive capacity for innovation to come alive. 
It's when the Internet combines with these kinds of passionate pro-am consumers -- who are knowledgeable; they've got the incentive to innovate; they've got the tools; they want to -- that you get this kind of explosion of creative collaboration. 
And out of that, you get the need for the kind of things that Jimmy was talking about, which is our new kinds of organization, or a better way to put it: how do we organize ourselves without organizations? 
That's now possible; you don't need an organization to be organized, to achieve large and complex tasks, like innovating new software programs. 
So this is a huge challenge to the way we think creativity comes about. 
The traditional view, still enshrined in much of the way that we think about creativity -- in organizations, in government -- is that creativity is about special people: wear baseball caps the wrong way round, come to conferences like this, in special places, elite universities, R&amp;D labs in the forests, water, maybe special rooms in companies painted funny colors, you know, bean bags, maybe the odd table-football table. 
Special people, special places, think up special ideas, then you have a pipeline that takes the ideas down to the waiting consumers, who are passive. 
They can say "yes" or "no" to the invention. 
That's the idea of creativity. 
What's the policy recommendation out of that if you're in government, or you're running a large company? 
More special people, more special places. 
Build creative clusters in cities; create more R&amp;D parks, so on and so forth. 
Expand the pipeline down to the consumers. 
Well this view, I think, is increasingly wrong. 
I think it's always been wrong, because I think always creativity has been highly collaborative, and it's probably been largely interactive. 
But it's increasingly wrong, and one of the reasons it's wrong is that the ideas are flowing back up the pipeline. 
The ideas are coming back from the consumers, and they're often ahead of the producers. 
Why is that? 
Well, one issue is that radical innovation, when you've got ideas that affect a large number of technologies or people, have a great deal of uncertainty attached to them. 
The payoffs to innovation are greatest where the uncertainty is highest. 
And when you get a radical innovation, it's often very uncertain how it can be applied. 
The whole history of telephony is a story of dealing with that uncertainty. 
The very first landline telephones, the inventors thought that they would be used for people to listen in to live performances from West End theaters. 
When the mobile telephone companies invented SMS, they had no idea what it was for; it was only when that technology got into the hands of teenage users that they invented the use. 
So the more radical the innovation, the more the uncertainty, the more you need innovation in use to work out what a technology is for. 
All of our patents, our entire approach to patents and invention, is based on the idea that the inventor knows what the invention is for; we can say what it's for. 
More and more, the inventors of things will not be able to say that in advance. 
It will be worked out in use, in collaboration with users. 
We like to think that invention is a sort of moment of creation: there is a moment of birth when someone comes up with an idea. 
The truth is that most creativity is cumulative and collaborative; like Wikipedia, it develops over a long period of time. 
The second reason why users are more and more important is that they are the source of big, disruptive innovations. 
If you want to find the big new ideas, it's often difficult to find them in mainstream markets, in big organizations. 
And just look inside large organizations and you'll see why that is so. 
So, you're in a big corporation. 
You're obviously keen to go up the corporate ladder. 
Do you go into your board and say, "Look, I've got a fantastic idea for an embryonic product in a marginal market, with consumers we've never dealt with before, and I'm not sure it's going to have a big payoff, but it could be really, really big in the future?" 
No, what you do, is you go in and you say, "I've got a fantastic idea for an incremental innovation to an existing product we sell through existing channels to existing users, and I can guarantee you get this much return out of it over the next three years." 
Big corporations have an in-built tendency to reinforce past success. 
They've got so much sunk in it that it's very difficult for them to spot emerging new markets. Emerging new markets, then, are the breeding grounds for passionate users. 
Best example: who in the music industry, 30 years ago, would have said, "Yes, let's invent a musical form which is all about dispossessed black men in ghettos expressing their frustration with the world through a form of music that many people find initially quite difficult to listen to. 
That sounds like a winner; we'll go with it." 
So what happens? Rap music is created by the users. 
They do it on their own tapes, with their own recording equipment; they distribute it themselves. 
30 years later, rap music is the dominant musical form of popular culture -- would never have come from the big companies. 
Had to start -- this is the third point -- This is the phrase that I've used in some stuff which I've done with a think tank in London called Demos, where we've been looking at these people who are amateurs -- i.e., they do it for the love of it -- but they want to do it to very high standards. 
And across a whole range of fields -- from software, astronomy, natural sciences, vast areas of leisure and culture like kite-surfing, so on and so forth -- you find people who want to do things because they love it, but they want to do these things to very high standards. 
They work at their leisure, if you like. 
They take their leisure very seriously: they acquire skills; they invest time; they use technology that's getting cheaper -- it's not just the Internet: cameras, design technology, leisure technology, surfboards, so on and so forth. 
Largely through globalization, a lot of this equipment has got a lot cheaper. 
More knowledgeable consumers, more educated, more able to connect with one another, more able to do things together. 
Consumption, in that sense, is an expression of their productive potential. 
Why, we found, people were interested in this, is that at work they don't feel very expressed. 
They don't feel as if they're doing something that really matters to them, so they pick up these kinds of activities. 
This has huge organizational implications for very large areas of life. 
Take astronomy as an example, which Yochai has already mentioned. 
Twenty years ago, 30 years ago, only big professional astronomers with very big telescopes could see far into space. 
And there's a big telescope in Northern England called Jodrell Bank, and when I was a kid, it was amazing, because the moon shots would take off, and this thing would move on rails. 
And it was huge -- it was absolutely enormous. 
Now, six amateur astronomers, working with the Internet, with Dobsonian digital telescopes -- which are pretty much open source -- with some light sensors developed over the last 10 years, the Internet -- they can do what Jodrell Bank could only do 30 years ago. 
So here in astronomy, you have this vast explosion of new productive resources. 
The users can be producers. 
What does this mean, then, for our organizational landscape? 
Well, just imagine a world, for the moment, divided into two camps. 
Over here, you've got the old, traditional corporate model: special people, special places; patent it, push it down the pipeline to largely waiting, passive consumers. 
Over here, let's imagine we've got Wikipedia, Linux, and beyond -- open source. 
This is open; this is closed. 
This is new; this is traditional. 
Well, the first thing you can say, I think with certainty, is what Yochai has said already -- is there is a great big struggle between those two organizational forms. 
These people over there will do everything they can to stop these kinds of organizations succeeding, because they're threatened by them. 
And so the debates about copyright, digital rights, so on and so forth -- these are all about trying to stifle, in my view, these kinds of organizations. 
What we're seeing is a complete corruption of the idea of patents and copyright. 
Meant to be a way to incentivize invention, meant to be a way to orchestrate the dissemination of knowledge, they are increasingly being used by large companies to create thickets of patents to prevent innovation taking place. 
Let me just give you two examples. 
The first is: imagine yourself going to a venture capitalist and saying, "I've got a fantastic idea. 
I've invented this brilliant new program that is much, much better than Microsoft Outlook." 
Which venture capitalist in their right mind is going to give you any money to set up a venture competing with Microsoft, with Microsoft Outlook? No one. 
That is why the competition with Microsoft is bound to come -- will only come -- from an open-source kind of project. 
So, there is a huge competitive argument about sustaining the capacity for open-source and consumer-driven innovation, because it's one of the greatest competitive levers against monopoly. 
There'll be huge professional arguments as well. 
Because the professionals, over here in these closed organizations -- they might be academics; they might be programmers; they might be doctors; they might be journalists -- my former profession -- say, "No, no -- you can't trust these people over here." 
When I started in journalism -- Financial Times, 20 years ago -- it was very, very exciting to see someone reading the newspaper. 
And you'd kind of look over their shoulder on the Tube to see if they were reading your article. 
Usually they were reading the share prices, and the bit of the paper with your article on was on the floor, or something like that, and you know, "For heaven's sake, what are they doing! 
They're not reading my brilliant article!" 
And we allowed users, readers, two places where they could contribute to the paper: the letters page, where they could write a letter in, and we would condescend to them, cut it in half, and print it three days later. 
Or the op-ed page, where if they knew the editor -- had been to school with him, slept with his wife -- they could write an article for the op-ed page. 
Those were the two places. 
Shock, horror: now, the readers want to be writers and publishers. 
That's not their role; they're supposed to read what we write. 
But they don't want to be journalists. The journalists think that the bloggers want to be journalists; they don't want to be journalists; they just want to have a voice. 
They want to, as Jimmy said, they want to have a dialogue, a conversation. 
They want to be part of that flow of information. 
What's happening there is that the whole domain of creativity is expanding. 
So, there's going to be a tremendous struggle. 
But, also, there's going to be tremendous movement from the open to the closed. 
What you'll see, I think, is two things that are critical, and these, I think, are two challenges for the open movement. 
The first is: can we really survive on volunteers? 
If this is so critical, do we not need it funded, organized, supported in much more structured ways? 
I think the idea of creating the Red Cross for information and knowledge is a fantastic idea, but can we really organize that, just on volunteers? 
What kind of changes do we need in public policy and funding to make that possible? 
What's the role of the BBC, for instance, in that world? 
What should be the role of public policy? 
And finally, what I think you will see is the intelligent, closed organizations moving increasingly in the open direction. 
So it's not going to be a contest between two camps, but, in between them, you'll find all sorts of interesting places that people will occupy. 
New organizational models coming about, mixing closed and open in tricky ways. 
It won't be so clear-cut; it won't be Microsoft versus Linux -- there'll be all sorts of things in between. 
And those organizational models, it turns out, are incredibly powerful, and the people who can understand them will be very, very successful. 
Let me just give you one final example of what that means. 
I was in Shanghai, in an office block built on what was a rice paddy five years ago -- one of the 2,500 skyscrapers they've built in Shanghai in the last 10 years. 
And I was having dinner with this guy called Timothy Chan. 
Timothy Chan set up an Internet business in 2000. 
Didn't go into the Internet, kept his money, decided to go into computer games. 
He runs a company called Shanda, which is the largest computer games company in China. 
Nine thousand servers all over China, has 250 million subscribers. 
At any one time, there are four million people playing one of his games. 
How many people does he employ to service that population? 
500 people. 
Well, how can he service 250 million people from 500 employees? 
Because basically, he doesn't service them. 
He gives them a platform; he gives them some rules; he gives them the tools and then he kind of orchestrates the conversation; he orchestrates the action. 
But actually, a lot of the content is created by the users themselves. 
And it creates a kind of stickiness between the community and the company which is really, really powerful. 
The best measure of that: so you go into one of his games, you create a character that you develop in the course of the game. 
If, for some reason, your credit card bounces, or there's some other problem, you lose your character. 
You've got two options. 
One option: you can create a new character, right from scratch, but with none of the history of your player. 
That costs about 100 dollars. 
Or you can get on a plane, fly to Shanghai, queue up outside Shanda's offices -- cost probably 600, 700 dollars -- and reclaim your character, get your history back. 
Every morning, there are 600 people queuing outside their offices to reclaim these characters.  So this is about companies built on communities, that provide communities with tools, resources, platforms in which they can share. 
He's not open source, but it's very, very powerful. 
So here is one of the challenges, I think, for people like me, who do a lot of work with government. 
If you're a games company, and you've got a million players in your game, you only need one percent of them to be co-developers, contributing ideas, and you've got a development workforce of 10,000 people. 
Imagine you could take all the children in education in Britain, and one percent of them were co-developers of education. 
What would that do to the resources available to the education system? 
Or if you got one percent of the patients in the NHS to, in some sense, be co-producers of health. 
The reason why -- despite all the efforts to cut it down, to constrain it, to hold it back -- why these open models will still start emerging with tremendous force, is that they multiply our productive resources. 
And one of the reasons they do that is that they turn users into producers, consumers into designers. 
Thank you very much.

<title>Jeff Han: The radical promise of the multi-touch interface</title> 
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Jeff Han shows off a cheap, scalable multi-touch and pressure-sensitive computer screen interface that may spell the end of point-and-click.</description> 
I'm really excited to be here today. 
I'll show you some stuff that's just ready to come out of the lab, literally, and I'm really glad that you guys are going to be among the first to see it in person, because I really think this is going to really change the way we interact with machines from this point on. 
Now, this is a rear-projected drafting table. It's about 36 inches wide and it's equipped with a multi-touch sensor. Normal touch sensors that you see, like on a kiosk or interactive whiteboards, can only register one point of contact at a time. 
This thing allows you to have multiple points at the same time. 
They can use both my hands; I can use chording actions; I can just go right up and use all 10 fingers if I wanted to. 
You know, like that. 
Now, multi-touch sensing isn't completely new. 
People like Bill Buxton have been playing around with it in the '80s. 
However, the approach I built here is actually high-resolution, low-cost, and probably most importantly, very scalable. 
So, the technology, you know, isn't the most exciting thing here right now, other than probably its newfound accessibility. 
What's really interesting here is what you can do with it and the kind of interfaces you can build on top of it. So let's see. 
So, for instance, we have a lava lamp application here. Now, you can see, I can use both of my hands to kind of squeeze and put the blobs together. 
I can inject heat into the system here, or I can pull it apart with two of my fingers. 
It's completely intuitive; there's no instruction manual. 
The interface just kind of disappears. This started out as a screensaver app that one of the Ph.D. students in our lab, Ilya Rosenberg, made. 
But I think its true identity comes out here. 
Now what's great about a multi-touch sensor is that, you know, I could be doing this with as many fingers here, but of course multi-touch also inherently means multi-user. 
Chris could be interacting with another part of Lava, while I play around with it here. You can imagine a new kind of sculpting tool, where I'm kind of warming something up, making it malleable, and then letting it cool down and solidifying in a certain state. 
Google should have something like this in their lobby.  I'll show you a little more of a concrete example here, as this thing loads. 
This is a photographer's light-box application. 
Again, I can use both of my hands to interact and move photos around. 
But what's even cooler is that if I have two fingers, I can actually grab a photo and then stretch it out like that really easily. 
I can pan, zoom and rotate it effortlessly. 
I can do that grossly with both of my hands, or I can do it just with two fingers on each of my hands together. 
If I grab the canvas, I can do the same thing -- stretch it out. 
I can do it simultaneously, holding this down, and gripping on another one, stretching this out. 
Again, the interface just disappears here. 
There's no manual. This is exactly what you expect, especially if you haven't interacted with a computer before. 
Now, when you have initiatives like the $100 laptop, I kind of cringe at the idea of introducing a whole new generation to computing with this standard mouse-and-windows-pointer interface. 
This is something that I think is really the way we should be interacting with machines from now on. 
 Now, of course, I can bring up a keyboard. 
And I can bring that around, put that up there. 
Obviously, this is a standard keyboard, but of course I can rescale it to make it work well for my hands. 
That's really important, because there's no reason in this day and age that we should be conforming to a physical device. 
That leads to bad things, like RSI. 
We have so much technology nowadays that these interfaces should start conforming to us. 
There's so little applied now to actually improving the way we interact with interfaces from this point on. 
This keyboard is probably actually the really wrong direction to go. 
You can imagine, in the future, as we develop this kind of technology, a keyboard that kind of automatically drifts as your hand moves away, and really intelligently anticipates which key you're trying to stroke. 
So -- again, isn't this great? 
Audience: Where's your lab? 
Jeff Han: I'm a research scientist at NYU in New York. 
Here's an example of another kind of app. I can make these little fuzz balls. 
It'll remember the strokes I'm making. Of course I can do it with all my hands. 
It's pressure-sensitive. What's neat about that is, I showed that two-finger gesture that zooms in really quickly. 
Because you don't have to switch to a hand tool or the magnifying glass tool, you can just continuously make things in real multiple scales, all at the same time. 
I can create big things out here, but I can go back and really quickly go back to where I started, and make even smaller things here. 
This is going to be really important as we start getting to things like data visualization. 
For instance, I think we all enjoyed Hans Rosling's talk, and he really emphasized the fact I've been thinking about for a long time: We have all this great data, but for some reason, it's just sitting there. 
We're not accessing it. And one of the reasons why I think that is will be helped by things like graphics and visualization and inference tools, but I also think a big part of it is going to be having better interfaces, to be able to drill down into this kind of data, while still thinking about the big picture here. 
Let me show you another app here. This is called WorldWind. 
It's done by NASA. We've all seen Google Earth; this is an open-source version of that. 
There are plug-ins to be able to load in different data sets that NASA's collected over the years. 
As you can see, I can use the same two-fingered gestures to go down and go in really seamlessly. There's no interface, again. It really allows anybody to kind of go in -- and it just does what you'd expect, you know? 
Again, there's just no interface here. The interface just disappears. 
I can switch to different data views. That's what's neat about this app here. 
NASA's really cool. These hyper-spectral images are false-colored so you can -- it's really good for determining vegetative use. Well, let's go back to this. 
The great thing about mapping applications -- it's not really 2D, it's 3D. 
So, again, with a multi-point interface, you can do a gesture like this -- so you can be able to tilt around like that -- It's not just simply relegated to a kind of 2D panning and motion. 
This gesture is just putting two fingers down -- it's defining an axis of tilt -- and I can tilt up and down that way. 
We just came up with that on the spot, it's probably not the right thing to do, but there's such interesting things you can do with this interface. 
It's just so much fun playing around with it, too.  And so the last thing I want to show you is -- I'm sure we can all think of a lot of entertainment apps that you can do with this thing. 
I'm more interested in the creative applications we can do with this. 
Now, here's a simple application here -- I can draw out a curve. 
And when I close it, it becomes a character. 
But the neat thing about it is I can add control points. 
And then what I can do is manipulate them with both of my fingers at the same time. 
And you notice what it does. 
It's kind of a puppeteering thing, where I can use as many fingers as I have to draw and make -- Now, there's a lot of actual math going on under here for this to control this mesh and do the right thing. 
This technique of being able to manipulate a mesh here, with multiple control points, is actually state of the art. 
It was released at SIGGRAPH last year. 
It's a great example of the kind of research I really love: all this compute power to make things do the right things, intuitive things, to do exactly what you expect. 
So, multi-touch interaction research is a very active field right now in HCI. 
I'm not the only one doing it, a lot of other people are getting into it. 
This kind of technology is going to let even more people get into it, I'm looking forward to interacting with all of you over the next few days and seeing how it can apply to your respective fields. 
Thank you.

<title>Ken Robinson: Do schools kill creativity?</title> 
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Sir Ken Robinson makes an entertaining and profoundly moving case for creating an education system that nurtures (rather than undermines) creativity.</description> 
Good morning. How are you?  It's been great, hasn't it? 
I've been blown away by the whole thing. 
In fact, I'm leaving. 
There have been three themes running through the conference which are relevant to what I want to talk about. 
One is the extraordinary evidence of human creativity in all of the presentations that we've had and in all of the people here. Just the variety of it and the range of it. 
The second is that it's put us in a place where we have no idea what's going to happen, in terms of the future. 
No idea how this may play out. 
I have an interest in education. 
Actually, what I find is everybody has an interest in education. 
Don't you? I find this very interesting. 
If you're at a dinner party, and you say you work in education -- Actually, you're not often at dinner parties, frankly.  If you work in education, you're not asked. 
 And you're never asked back, curiously. That's strange to me. 
But if you are, and you say to somebody, you know, they say, "What do you do?" 
and you say you work in education, you can see the blood run from their face. 
They're like, "Oh my God," you know, "Why me?"  But if you ask about their education, they pin you to the wall. 
Because it's one of those things that goes deep with people, am I right? 
Like religion, and money and other things. 
So I have a big interest in education, and I think we all do. 
We have a huge vested interest in it, partly because it's education that's meant to take us into this future that we can't grasp. 
If you think of it, children starting school this year will be retiring in 2065. Nobody has a clue, despite all the expertise that's been on parade for the past four days, what the world will look like in five years' time. 
And yet we're meant to be educating them for it. 
So the unpredictability, I think, is extraordinary. 
And the third part of this is that we've all agreed, nonetheless, on the really extraordinary capacities that children have -- their capacities for innovation. I mean, Sirena last night was a marvel, wasn't she? 
Just seeing what she could do. 
And she's exceptional, but I think she's not, so to speak, exceptional in the whole of childhood. 
What you have there is a person of extraordinary dedication who found a talent. 
And my contention is, all kids have tremendous talents. 
And we squander them, pretty ruthlessly. 
So I want to talk about education and I want to talk about creativity. 
My contention is that creativity now is as important in education as literacy, and we should treat it with the same status. 
 Thank you.   So, 15 minutes left.  Well, I was born... no.  I heard a great story recently -- I love telling it -- of a little girl who was in a drawing lesson. 
She was six, and she was at the back, drawing, and the teacher said this girl hardly ever paid attention, and in this drawing lesson, she did. 
The teacher was fascinated. 
She went over to her, and she said, "What are you drawing?" 
And the girl said, "I'm drawing a picture of God." 
And the teacher said, "But nobody knows what God looks like." 
And the girl said, "They will, in a minute." 
 When my son was four in England -- Actually, he was four everywhere, to be honest.  If we're being strict about it, wherever he went, he was four that year. 
He was in the Nativity play. Do you remember the story? 
No, it was big, it was a big story. 
Mel Gibson did the sequel, you may have seen it.  "Nativity II." 
But James got the part of Joseph, which we were thrilled about. 
We considered this to be one of the lead parts. 
We had the place crammed full of agents in T-shirts: "James Robinson IS Joseph!"  He didn't have to speak, but you know the bit where the three kings come in? 
They come in bearing gifts, gold, frankincense and myrrh. 
This really happened. 
We were sitting there and I think they just went out of sequence, because we talked to the little boy afterward and we said, "You OK with that?" And he said, "Yeah, why? Was that wrong?" 
They just switched. 
The three boys came in, four-year-olds with tea towels on their heads, and they put these boxes down, and the first boy said, "I bring you gold." 
And the second boy said, "I bring you myrrh." 
And the third boy said, "Frank sent this."  What these things have in common is that kids will take a chance. 
If they don't know, they'll have a go. 
Am I right? They're not frightened of being wrong. 
I don't mean to say that being wrong is the same thing as being creative. 
What we do know is, if you're not prepared to be wrong, you'll never come up with anything original -- if you're not prepared to be wrong. 
And by the time they get to be adults, most kids have lost that capacity. 
They have become frightened of being wrong. 
And we run our companies like this. 
We stigmatize mistakes. 
And we're now running national education systems where mistakes are the worst thing you can make. 
And the result is that we are educating people out of their creative capacities. 
Picasso once said this, he said that all children are born artists. 
The problem is to remain an artist as we grow up. 
I believe this passionately, that we don't grow into creativity, we grow out of it. Or rather, we get educated out of it. 
So why is this? 
I lived in Stratford-on-Avon until about five years ago. 
In fact, we moved from Stratford to Los Angeles. 
So you can imagine what a seamless transition that was. 
 Actually, we lived in a place called Snitterfield, just outside Stratford, which is where Shakespeare's father was born. Are you struck by a new thought? I was. 
You don't think of Shakespeare having a father, do you? 
Do you? Because you don't think of Shakespeare being a child, do you? 
Shakespeare being seven? 
I never thought of it. 
I mean, he was seven at some point. 
He was in somebody's English class, wasn't he? 
 "Must try harder."  Being sent to bed by his dad, you know, to Shakespeare, "Go to bed, now! 
And put the pencil down."  "And stop speaking like that."  "It's confusing everybody." 
 Anyway, we moved from Stratford to Los Angeles, and I just want to say a word about the transition. 
My son didn't want to come. 
I've got two kids; he's 21 now, my daughter's 16. 
He didn't want to come to Los Angeles. 
He loved it, but he had a girlfriend in England. This was the love of his life, Sarah. 
He'd known her for a month. 
Mind you, they'd had their fourth anniversary, because it's a long time when you're 16. 
He was really upset on the plane, he said, "I'll never find another girl like Sarah." 
And we were rather pleased about that, frankly -- Because she was the main reason we were leaving the country. 
 But something strikes you when you move to America and travel around the world: Every education system on Earth has the same hierarchy of subjects. 
Every one. Doesn't matter where you go. 
You'd think it would be otherwise, but it isn't. 
At the top are mathematics and languages, then the humanities, and at the bottom are the arts. 
Everywhere on Earth. 
And in pretty much every system too, there's a hierarchy within the arts. 
Art and music are normally given a higher status in schools than drama and dance. There isn't an education system on the planet that teaches dance everyday to children the way we teach them mathematics. Why? 
Why not? I think this is rather important. 
I think math is very important, but so is dance. 
Children dance all the time if they're allowed to, we all do. 
We all have bodies, don't we? Did I miss a meeting? 
 Truthfully, what happens is, as children grow up, we start to educate them progressively from the waist up. 
And then we focus on their heads. 
And slightly to one side. 
If you were to visit education, as an alien, and say "What's it for, public education?" 
I think you'd have to conclude, if you look at the output, who really succeeds by this, who does everything that they should, who gets all the brownie points, who are the winners -- I think you'd have to conclude the whole purpose of public education throughout the world is to produce university professors. Isn't it? 
They're the people who come out the top. 
And I used to be one, so there.  And I like university professors, but you know, we shouldn't hold them up as the high-water mark of all human achievement. 
They're just a form of life, another form of life. 
But they're rather curious, and I say this out of affection for them. 
There's something curious about professors in my experience -- not all of them, but typically, they live in their heads. 
They live up there, and slightly to one side. 
They're disembodied, you know, in a kind of literal way. 
They look upon their body as a form of transport for their heads. 
It's a way of getting their head to meetings.  If you want real evidence of out-of-body experiences, get yourself along to a residential conference of senior academics, and pop into the discotheque on the final night. 
 And there, you will see it. 
Grown men and women writhing uncontrollably, off the beat. 
Waiting until it ends so they can go home and write a paper about it. 
Our education system is predicated on the idea of academic ability. 
And there's a reason. 
Around the world, there were no public systems of education, really, before the 19th century. 
They all came into being to meet the needs of industrialism. 
So the hierarchy is rooted on two ideas. 
Number one, that the most useful subjects for work are at the top. 
So you were probably steered benignly away from things at school when you were a kid, things you liked, on the grounds that you would never get a job doing that. Is that right? 
Don't do music, you're not going to be a musician; don't do art, you won't be an artist. 
Benign advice -- now, profoundly mistaken. 
The whole world is engulfed in a revolution. 
And the second is academic ability, which has really come to dominate our view of intelligence, because the universities designed the system in their image. 
If you think of it, the whole system of public education around the world is a protracted process of university entrance. 
And the consequence is that many highly-talented, brilliant, creative people think they're not, because the thing they were good at at school wasn't valued, or was actually stigmatized. 
And I think we can't afford to go on that way. 
In the next 30 years, according to UNESCO, more people worldwide will be graduating through education than since the beginning of history. 
More people, and it's the combination of all the things we've talked about -- technology and its transformation effect on work, and demography and the huge explosion in population. 
Suddenly, degrees aren't worth anything. Isn't that true? 
When I was a student, if you had a degree, you had a job. 
If you didn't have a job, it's because you didn't want one. 
And I didn't want one, frankly.  But now kids with degrees are often heading home to carry on playing video games, because you need an MA where the previous job required a BA, and now you need a PhD for the other. 
It's a process of academic inflation. 
And it indicates the whole structure of education is shifting beneath our feet. 
We need to radically rethink our view of intelligence. 
We know three things about intelligence. 
One, it's diverse. 
We think about the world in all the ways that we experience it. 
We think visually, we think in sound, we think kinesthetically. 
We think in abstract terms, we think in movement. 
Secondly, intelligence is dynamic. 
If you look at the interactions of a human brain, as we heard yesterday from a number of presentations, intelligence is wonderfully interactive. 
The brain isn't divided into compartments. 
In fact, creativity -- which I define as the process of having original ideas that have value -- more often than not comes about through the interaction of different disciplinary ways of seeing things. 
By the way, there's a shaft of nerves that joins the two halves of the brain called the corpus callosum. It's thicker in women. 
Following off from Helen yesterday, this is probably why women are better at multi-tasking. 
Because you are, aren't you? 
There's a raft of research, but I know it from my personal life. 
If my wife is cooking a meal at home -- which is not often, thankfully. 
 No, she's good at some things, but if she's cooking, she's dealing with people on the phone, she's talking to the kids, she's painting the ceiling, she's doing open-heart surgery over here. 
If I'm cooking, the door is shut, the kids are out, the phone's on the hook, if she comes in I get annoyed. 
I say, "Terry, please, I'm trying to fry an egg in here."  Actually, do you know that old philosophical thing, if a tree falls in a forest and nobody hears it, did it happen? 
Remember that old chestnut? 
I saw a great t-shirt recently, which said, "If a man speaks his mind in a forest, and no woman hears him, is he still wrong?"  And the third thing about intelligence is, it's distinct. I'm doing a new book at the moment called "Epiphany," which is based on a series of interviews with people about how they discovered their talent. 
I'm fascinated by how people got to be there. 
It's really prompted by a conversation I had with a wonderful woman who maybe most people have never heard of, Gillian Lynne. Have you heard of her? Some have. 
She's a choreographer, and everybody knows her work. 
She did "Cats" and "Phantom of the Opera." 
She's wonderful. I used to be on the board of The Royal Ballet, as you can see. 
Anyway, Gillian and I had lunch one day and I said, "How did you get to be a dancer?" 
It was interesting. 
When she was at school, she was really hopeless. 
And the school, in the '30s, wrote to her parents and said, "We think Gillian has a learning disorder." 
She couldn't concentrate; she was fidgeting. 
I think now they'd say she had ADHD. Wouldn't you? 
But this was the 1930s, and ADHD hadn't been invented at this point. 
It wasn't an available condition.  People weren't aware they could have that. 
 Anyway, she went to see this specialist. 
So, this oak-paneled room, and she was there with her mother, and she was led and sat on this chair at the end, and she sat on her hands for 20 minutes while this man talked to her mother about the problems Gillian was having at school. 
Because she was disturbing people; her homework was always late; and so on, little kid of eight. 
In the end, the doctor went and sat next to Gillian, and said, "I've listened to all these things your mother's told me, I need to speak to her privately. 
Wait here. We'll be back; we won't be very long," and they went and left her. 
But as they went out of the room, he turned on the radio that was sitting on his desk. 
And when they got out, he said to her mother, "Just stand and watch her." 
And the minute they left the room, she was on her feet, moving to the music. 
And they watched for a few minutes and he turned to her mother and said, "Mrs. Lynne, Gillian isn't sick; she's a dancer. 
Take her to a dance school." 
I said, "What happened?" 
She said, "She did. I can't tell you how wonderful it was. 
We walked in this room and it was full of people like me. 
People who couldn't sit still. 
People who had to move to think." Who had to move to think. 
They did ballet, they did tap, jazz; they did modern; they did contemporary. 
She was eventually auditioned for the Royal Ballet School; she became a soloist; she had a wonderful career at the Royal Ballet. 
She eventually graduated from the Royal Ballet School, founded the Gillian Lynne Dance Company, met Andrew Lloyd Webber. She's been responsible for some of the most successful musical theater productions in history, she's given pleasure to millions, and she's a multi-millionaire. 
Somebody else might have put her on medication and told her to calm down. 
 What I think it comes to is this: Al Gore spoke the other night about ecology and the revolution that was triggered by Rachel Carson. 
I believe our only hope for the future is to adopt a new conception of human ecology, one in which we start to reconstitute our conception of the richness of human capacity. 
Our education system has mined our minds in the way that we strip-mine the earth: for a particular commodity. 
And for the future, it won't serve us. 
We have to rethink the fundamental principles on which we're educating our children. 
There was a wonderful quote by Jonas Salk, who said, "If all the insects were to disappear from the Earth, within 50 years all life on Earth would end. 
If all human beings disappeared from the Earth, within 50 years all forms of life would flourish." 
And he's right. 
What TED celebrates is the gift of the human imagination. 
We have to be careful now that we use this gift wisely and that we avert some of the scenarios that we've talked about. 
And the only way we'll do it is by seeing our creative capacities for the richness they are and seeing our children for the hope that they are. 
And our task is to educate their whole being, so they can face this future. 
By the way -- we may not see this future, but they will. And our job is to help them make something of it. 
Thank you very much.

<title>Richard St. John: 8 secrets of success</title> 
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Why do people succeed? Is it because they're smart? Or are they just lucky? Neither. Analyst Richard St. John condenses years of interviews into an unmissable 3-minute slideshow on the real secrets of success.</description> 
This is really a two-hour presentation I give to high school students, cut down to three minutes. 
And it all started one day on a plane, on my way to TED, seven years ago. 
And in the seat next to me was a high school student, a teenager, and she came from a really poor family. 
And she wanted to make something of her life, and she asked me a simple little question. 
She said, "What leads to success?" 
And I felt really badly, because I couldn't give her a good answer. 
So I get off the plane, and I come to TED. 
And I think, jeez, I'm in the middle of a room of successful people! 
So why don't I ask them what helped them succeed, and pass it on to kids? 
So here we are, seven years, 500 interviews later, and I'm going to tell you what really leads to success and makes TEDsters tick. 
And the first thing is passion. 
Freeman Thomas says, "I'm driven by my passion." 
TEDsters do it for love; they don't do it for money. 
Carol Coletta says, "I would pay someone to do what I do." 
And the interesting thing is: if you do it for love, the money comes anyway. 
Work! Rupert Murdoch said to me, "It's all hard work. 
Nothing comes easily. But I have a lot of fun." 
Did he say fun? Rupert? Yes! 
TEDsters do have fun working. And they work hard. 
I figured, they're not workaholics. They're workafrolics.  Alex Garden says, "To be successful, put your nose down in something and get damn good at it." 
There's no magic; it's practice, practice, practice. 
And it's focus. Norman Jewison said to me, "I think it all has to do with focusing yourself on one thing." 
And push! David Gallo says, "Push yourself. 
Physically, mentally, you've got to push, push, push." 
You've got to push through shyness and self-doubt. 
Goldie Hawn says, "I always had self-doubts. 
I wasn't good enough; I wasn't smart enough. 
I didn't think I'd make it." 
Now it's not always easy to push yourself, and that's why they invented mothers.  Frank Gehry said to me, "My mother pushed me." 
Serve! Sherwin Nuland says, "It was a privilege to serve as a doctor." 
A lot of kids want to be millionaires. 
The first thing I say is: "OK, well you can't serve yourself; you've got to serve others something of value. 
Because that's the way people really get rich." 
TEDster Bill Gates says, "I had an idea: founding the first micro-computer software company." 
I'd say it was a pretty good idea. 
And there's no magic to creativity in coming up with ideas -- it's just doing some very simple things. 
And I give lots of evidence. 
Joe Kraus says, "Persistence is the number one reason for our success." 
You've got to persist through failure. You've got to persist through crap! 
Which of course means "Criticism, Rejection, Assholes and Pressure." 
 So, the answer to this question is simple: Pay 4,000 bucks and come to TED.  Or failing that, do the eight things -- and trust me, these are the big eight things that lead to success. 
Thank you TEDsters for all your interviews!

<title>Rick Warren: A life of purpose</title> 
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Pastor Rick Warren, author of "The Purpose-Driven Life," reflects on his own crisis of purpose in the wake of his book's wild success. He explains his belief that God's intention is for each of us to use our talents and influence to do good.</description> 
I'm often asked, "What surprised you about the book?" 
And I say, "That I got to write it." 
I would have never imagined that. 
Not in my wildest dreams did I think -- I don't even consider myself to be an author. 
And I'm often asked, "Why do you think so many people have read this? 
This thing's selling still about a million copies a month." 
And I think it's because spiritual emptiness is a universal disease. 
I think inside at some point, we put our heads down on the pillow and we go, "There's got to be more to life than this." 
Get up in the morning, go to work, come home and watch TV, go to bed, get up in the morning, go to work, come home, watch TV, go to bed, go to parties on weekends. 
A lot of people say, "I'm living." No, you're not living -- that's just existing. 
Just existing. 
I really think that there's this inner desire. 
I do believe what Chris said; I believe that you're not an accident. 
Your parents may not have planned you, but I believe God did. 
I think there are accidental parents; there's no doubt about that. 
I don't think there are accidental kids. 
And I think you matter. 
I think you matter to God; I think you matter to history; I think you matter to this universe. 
And I think that the difference between what I call the survival level of living, the success level of living, and the significance level of living is: Do you figure out, "What on Earth am I here for?" 
I meet a lot of people who are very smart, and say, "But why can't I figure out my problems?" 
And I meet a lot of people who are very successful, who say, "Why don't I feel more fulfilled? 
Why do I feel like a fake? 
Why do I feel like I've got to pretend that I'm more than I really am?" 
I think that comes down to this issue of meaning, of significance, of purpose. 
I think it comes down to this issue of: "Why am I here? What am I here for? Where am I going?" 
These are not religious issues. 
They're human issues. 
I wanted to tell Michael before he spoke that I really appreciate what he does, because it makes my life work a whole lot easier. 
As a pastor, I do see a lot of kooks. 
And I have learned that there are kooks in every area of life. 
Religion doesn't have a monopoly on that, but there are plenty of religious kooks. 
There are secular kooks; there are smart kooks, dumb kooks. 
There are people -- a lady came up to me the other day, and she had a white piece of paper -- Michael, you'll like this one -- and she said, "What do you see in it?" 
And I looked at it and I said, "Oh, I don't see anything." 
And she goes, "Well, I see Jesus," and started crying and left. 
I'm going, "OK," you know? "Fine." 
 Good for you. 
When the book became the best-selling book in the world for the last three years, I kind of had my little crisis. 
And that was: What is the purpose of this? 
Because it brought in enormous amounts of money. 
When you write the best-selling book in the world, it's tons and tons of money. 
And it brought in a lot of attention, neither of which I wanted. 
When I started Saddleback Church, I was 25 years old. 
I started it with one other family in 1980. 
And I decided that I was never going to go on TV, because I didn't want to be a celebrity. 
I didn't want to be a, quote, "evangelist, televangelist" -- that's not my thing. 
And all of the sudden, it brought a lot of money and a lot of attention. 
I don't think -- now, this is a worldview, and I will tell you, everybody's got a worldview. 
Everybody's betting their life on something. 
You're betting your life on something, you just better know why you're betting what you're betting on. 
So, everybody's betting their life on something. 
And when I, you know, made a bet, I happened to believe that Jesus was who he said he was. 
And I believe in a pluralistic society, everybody's betting on something. 
And when I started the church, you know, I had no plans to do what it's doing now. 
And then when I wrote this book, and all of a sudden, it just took off, and I started saying, now, what's the purpose of this? 
Because as I started to say, I don't think you're given money or fame for your own ego, ever. 
I just don't believe that. 
And when you write a book that the first sentence of the book is, "It's not about you," then, when all of a sudden it becomes the best-selling book in history, you've got to figure, well, I guess it's not about me. 
That's kind of a no-brainer. 
So, what is it for? 
And I began to think about what I call the "stewardship of affluence" and the "stewardship of influence." 
So I believe, essentially, leadership is stewardship. 
That if you are a leader in any area -- in business, in politics, in sports, in art, in academics, in any area -- you don't own it. 
You are a steward of it. 
For instance, that's why I believe in protecting the environment. 
This is not my planet. 
It wasn't mine before I was born, it's not going to be mine after I die, I'm just here for 80 years and then that's it. 
I was debating the other day on a talk show, and the guy was challenging me and he'd go, "What's a pastor doing on protecting the environment?" 
And I asked this guy, I said, "Well, do you believe that human beings are responsible to make the world a little bit better place for the next generation? 
Do you think we have a stewardship here, to take the environment seriously?" 
And he said, "No." 
I said, "Oh, you don't?" I said, "Let me make this clear again: Do you believe that as human beings -- I'm not talking about religion -- do you believe that as human beings, it is our responsibility to take care of this planet, and make it just a little bit better for the next generation?" 
And he said, "No. Not any more than any other species." 
When he said the word "species," he was revealing his worldview. 
And he was saying, "I'm no more responsible to take care of this environment than a duck is." 
Well now, I know a lot of times we act like ducks, but you're not a duck. 
You're not a duck. 
And you are responsible -- that's my worldview. 
And so, you need to understand what your worldview is. 
The problem is most people never really think it through. 
They never really ... 
codify it or qualify it or quantify it, and say, "This is what I believe in. This is why I believe what I believe." 
I don't personally have enough faith to be an atheist. 
But you may, you may. 
Your worldview, though, does determine everything else in your life, because it determines your decisions; it determines your relationships; it determines your level of confidence. 
It determines, really, everything in your life. 
What we believe, obviously -- and you know this -- determines our behavior, and our behavior determines what we become in life. 
So all of this money started pouring in, and all of this fame started pouring in. 
And I'm going, what do I do with this? 
My wife and I first made five decisions on what to do with the money. 
We said, "First, we're not going to use it on ourselves." 
I didn't go out and buy a bigger house. 
I don't own a guesthouse. 
I still drive the same four year-old Ford that I've driven. 
We just said, we're not going to use it on us. 
The second thing was, I stopped taking a salary from the church that I pastor. 
Third thing is, I added up all that the church had paid me over the last 25 years, and I gave it back. 
And I gave it back because I didn't want anybody thinking that I do what I do for money -- I don't. 
In fact, personally, I've never met a priest or a pastor or a minister who does it for money. 
I know that's the stereotype; I've never met one of them. 
Believe me, there's a whole lot easier ways to make money. 
Pastors are like on 24 hours-a-day call, they're like doctors. 
I left late today -- I'd hoped to be here yesterday -- because my father-in-law is in his last, probably, 48 hours before he dies of cancer. 
And I'm watching a guy who's lived his life -- he's now in his mid-80s -- and he's dying with peace. 
You know, the test of your worldview is not how you act in the good times. 
The test of your worldview is how you act at the funeral. 
And having been through literally hundreds if not thousands of funerals, it makes a difference. 
It makes a difference what you believe. 
So, we gave it all back, and then we set up three foundations, working on some of the major problems of the world: illiteracy, poverty, pandemic diseases -- particularly HIV/AIDS -- and set up these three foundations, and put the money into that. 
The last thing we did is we became what I call "reverse tithers." 
And that is, when my wife and I got married 30 years ago, we started tithing. 
Now, that's a principle in the Bible that says give 10 percent of what you get back to charity, give it away to help other people. 
So, we started doing that, and each year we would raise our tithe one percent. 
So, our first year of marriage we went to 11 percent, second year we went to 12 percent, and the third year we went to 13 percent, and on and on and on. Why did I do that? 
Because every time I give, it breaks the grip of materialism in my life. 
Materialism is all about getting -- get, get, get, get all you can, can all you get, sit on the can and spoil the rest. 
It's all about more, having more. 
And we think that the good life is actually looking good -- that's most important of all -- looking good, feeling good and having the goods. 
But that's not the good life. 
I meet people all the time who have those, and they're not necessarily happy. 
If money actually made you happy, then the wealthiest people in the world would be the happiest. 
And that I know, personally, I know, is not true. 
It's just not true. 
So, the good life is not about looking good, feeling good or having the goods, it's about being good and doing good. 
Giving your life away. 
Significance in life doesn't come from status, because you can always find somebody who's got more than you. 
It doesn't come from sex. 
It doesn't come from salary. 
It comes from serving. 
It is in giving our lives away that we find meaning, we find significance. 
That's the way we were wired, I believe, by God. 
And so we began to give away, and now after 30 years, my wife and I are reverse tithers -- we give away 90 percent and live on 10. 
That, actually, was the easy part. 
The hard part is, what do I do with all this attention? 
Because I started getting all kinds of invitations. 
I just came off a nearly month-long speaking tour on three different continents, and I won't go into that, but it was an amazing thing. 
And I'm going, what do I do with this notoriety that the book has brought? 
And, being a pastor, I started reading the Bible. 
There's a chapter in the Bible called Psalm 72, and it's Solomon's prayer for more influence. 
When you read this prayer, it sounds incredibly selfish, self-centered. 
He says, "God, I want you to make me famous." 
That's what he prays. 
He said, "I want you to make me famous. 
I want you to spread the fame of my name through every land, I want you to give me power. 
I want you to make me famous, I want you to give me influence." 
And it just sounds like the most egotistical request you could make, if you were going to pray. 
Until you read the whole psalm, the whole chapter. 
And then he says, "So that the king ..." -- he was the king of Israel at that time, at its apex in power -- "... so that the king may care for the widow and orphan, support the oppressed, defend the defenseless, care for the sick, assist the poor, speak up for the foreigner, those in prison." 
Basically, he's talking about all the marginalized in society. 
And as I read that, I looked at it, and I thought, you know, what this is saying is that the purpose of influence is to speak up for those who have no influence. 
The purpose of influence is not to build your ego. 
Or your net worth. 
And, by the way, your net worth is not the same thing as your self-worth. 
Your value is not based on your valuables. 
It's based on a whole different set of things. 
And so the purpose of influence is to speak up for those who have no influence. 
And I had to admit: I can't think of the last time I thought of widows and orphans. 
They're not on my radar. 
I pastor a church in one of the most affluent areas of America -- a bunch of gated communities. 
I have a church full of CEOs and scientists. 
And I could go five years and never, ever see a homeless person. 
They're just not in my pathway. 
Now, they're 13 miles up the road in Santa Ana. 
So I had to say, ok, I would use whatever affluence and whatever influence I've got to help those who don't have either of those. 
You know, there's a story in the Bible about Moses, whether you believe it's true or not, it really doesn't matter to me. 
But Moses, if you saw the movie, "The Ten Commandments," Moses goes out, and there's this burning bush, and God talks to him, and God says, "Moses, what's in your hand?" 
I think that's one of the most important questions you'll ever be asked: What's in your hand? 
Moses says, "It's a staff. It's a shepherd's staff." 
And God says, "Throw it down." 
And if you saw the movie, you know, he throws it down and it becomes a snake. 
And then God says, "Pick it up." 
And he picks it back up again, and it becomes a staff again. 
Now, I'm reading this thing, and I'm going, what is that all about? 
OK. What's that all about? Well, I do know a couple of things. 
Number one, God never does a miracle to show off. 
It's not just, "Wow, isn't that cool?" 
And, by the way, my God doesn't have to show up on cheese bread. 
You know, if God's going to show up, he's not going to show up on cheese bread. 
 Ok? I just, this is why I love what Michael does, because it's like, if he's debunking it, then I don't have to. 
But God -- my God -- doesn't show up on sprinkler images. 
He's got a few more powerful ways than that to do whatever he wants to do. 
But he doesn't do miracles just to show off. 
Second thing is, if God ever asks you a question, he already knows the answer. 
Obviously, if he's God, then that would mean that when he asks the question, it's for your benefit, not his. 
So he's going, "What's in your hand?" 
Now, what was in Moses' hand? 
Well, it was a shepherd's staff. Now, follow me on this. 
This staff represented three things about Moses' life. 
First, it represented his identity; he was a shepherd. 
It's the symbol of his own occupation: I am a shepherd. 
It's a symbol of his identity, his career, his job. 
Second, it's a symbol of not only his identity, it's a symbol of his income, because all of his assets are tied up in sheep. 
In those days, nobody had bank accounts, or American Express cards, or hedge funds. 
Your assets are tied up in your flocks. 
So it's a symbol of his identity, and it's a symbol of his income. 
And the third thing: it's a symbol of his influence. 
What do you do with a shepherd's staff? 
Well, you know, you move sheep from point A to point B with it, by hook or by crook. 
You pull them or you poke them. One or the other. 
So, he's saying, "You're going to lay down your identity. 
What's in your hand? You've got identity, you've got income, you've got influence. 
What's in your hand?" 
And he's saying, "If you lay it down, I'll make it come alive. 
I'll do some things you could never imagine possible." 
And if you've watched that movie, "Ten Commandments," all of those big miracles that happen in Egypt are done through this staff. 
Last year, I was invited to speak at the NBA All-Stars game. 
And so, I'm talking to the players, because most of the NBA teams, NFL teams and all the other teams have done this 40 Days of Purpose, based on the book. 
And I asked them, I said, "What's in your hand? 
So, what's in your hand?" I said, "It's a basketball. 
And that basketball represents your identity, who you are: you're an NBA player. It represents your income: you're making a lot of money off that little ball. 
And it represents your influence. 
And even though you're only going to be in the NBA for a few years, you're going to be an NBA player for the rest of your life. 
And that gives you enormous influence. 
So, what are you going to do with what you've been given?" 
And I guess that's the main reason I came up here today, to all of you very bright people at TED -- it is to say, "What's in your hand?" 
What do you have that you've been given? 
Talent, background, education, freedom, networks, opportunities, wealth, ideas, creativity. 
What are you doing with what you've been given? 
That, to me, is the primary question about life. 
That, to me, is what being purpose-driven is all about. 
In the book, I talk about how you're wired to do certain things, you're "SHAPED" with -- a little acrostic: Spiritual gifts, Heart, Ability, Personality and Experiences. 
These things shape you. 
And if you want to know what you ought to be doing with your life, you need to look at your shape -- "What am I wired to do?" 
Why would God wire you to do something and then not have you do it? 
If you're wired to be an anthropologist, you'll be an anthropologist. 
If you're wired to be an undersea explorer, you'll be an undersea explorer. 
If you're wired to make deals, you make deals. 
If you're wired to paint, you paint. 
Did you know that God smiles when you be you? 
When my little kids -- when my kids were little -- they're all grown now, I have grandkids -- I used to go in and sit on the side of their bed, and I used to watch my kids sleep. 
And I just watched their little bodies rise and lower, rise and lower. 
And I would look at them: "This is not an accident." 
Rise and lower. 
And I got joy out of just watching them sleep. 
Some people have the misguided idea that God only gets excited when you're doing, quote, "spiritual things," like going to church or helping the poor, or, you know, confessing or doing something like that. 
The bottom line is, God gets pleasure watching you be you. Why? He made you. 
And when you do what you were made to do, he goes, "That's my boy! That's my girl! 
You're using the talent and ability that I gave you." 
So my advice to you is: look at what's in your hand -- your identity, your influence, your income -- and say, "It's not about me. 
It's about making the world a better place." 
Thank you.

<title>Chris Anderson: Technology's long tail</title> 
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Chris Anderson, then the editor of Wired, explores the four key stages of any viable technology: setting the right price, gaining market share, displacing an established technology and, finally, becoming ubiquitous.</description> 
I'd like to speak about technology trends, which is something that many of you follow -- but we also follow, for related reasons. 
Obviously, being a technology magazine, technology trends are something that we write about and need to know about. 
But also it's part of being any monthly magazine -- you live in the future. And we have a long lead-time. 
We have to plan issues many months in advance; we have to guess at what public appetites are going to be six months, nine months down the road. So we're in the forecasting business. 
We also, like a lot of companies, create a product that's based on technology trends. 
In this case, ours is about ideas and information, and, if we're lucky, some entertainment. But the concept's quite the same. 
And so we have to understand not only why tech's important, where it's going, but also, very importantly, when -- the timing is everything. 
And it's interesting, when you look at the predictions made during the peak of the boom in the 1990s, about e-commerce, or Internet traffic, or broadband adoption, or Internet advertising, they were all right -- they were just wrong in time. 
Almost every one of those has come true just a few years later. 
But the difference of a few years on stock-market valuations is obviously extreme. And that's why timing is everything. 
You've probably seen something like this before. 
This is the classic Gartner Hype Curve, which talks about kind of the trajectory of a technology's lifespan. 
And just for fun, we put a bunch of technologies on it, to show whether they were kind of rising for the first high peak, or whether they were about to crash into the trough of disillusionment, or rise back in the slope of enlightenment, etc. 
And this is one way to do technology forecasting: get a sense of where technology is and then anticipate the next upturn. 
We tend to do any technology that we think is sufficiently important; we'll typically do it twice. Once, we want to do it first. 
We want to be the first to do it, for the geeks who appreciate that, we'll catch it right there at the technology-trigger. 
You can see in 1997, we put Linux on the cover. 
But then it comes back. And sufficiently big technologies are going to hit the mainstream, and they're going to burst out. 
And then it's time to do it again. Last year. 
And that's one way that we try to time technology trends. 
I'd like to talk about a way of thinking about technology trends that I call my "grand unified theory of predicting the future," but it's closer to a petite unified theory of predicting the future. 
It's based on the presumption, the observation even, that all important technologies go through four stages in their life -- at least one of the four stages, sometimes all four of the stages. 
And at each one of these stages, can be seen as a collision -- a collision with something else -- for example, a critical price-line that changes both the technology and also changes its effect on the world. It's an inflection point. 
And these are the inflection points that tell you what the next chapter in that technology's life is going to be, and maybe how you can do something about it. 
The first is the critical price. 
The first stage in a technology's advance is that it'll fall below a critical price. 
After it falls below a critical price, it will tend, if it's successful, to rise above a critical mass, a penetration. 
Many technologies, at that point, displace another technology, and that's another important point. 
And then finally, a lot of technologies commoditize. 
Towards the end of their life, they become nearly free. 
Each one of those is an opportunity to do something about it; it's an opportunity for the technology to change. 
And even if you missed, you know, the first boom of Wi-Fi -- you know, Wi-Fi did the critical price, it did the critical mass, but hasn't done displacement yet, and hasn't done free yet -- there's still more opportunity in that. 
I'd like to demonstrate what I mean by this by telling the story of the DVD, which is a technology which has done all of these. 
The DVD, as you know, was introduced in the mid-1990s and it was quite expensive. But you can see that by 1998, it had fallen below 400 dollars, and 400 dollars was a psychological threshold. 
And it started to take off. And you can see that the units started to trend up, the hidden inflection point -- it was taking off. 
The next thing it hit, a year later, was critical mass. In this case, 20 percent is often a good proxy for critical mass in a household. 
And what's interesting here is that something else took off along with it: home-theater units. 
Suddenly you have a DVD in the house; you've got high-quality digital video; you have a reason to have a big-screen television; you have a reason for Dolby 5.1 surround-sound. 
And maybe you have reasons for starting to connect them, and bring the rest of your entertainment in. 
What's interesting also is -- note that Netflix was founded in 1999. 
Reed Hastings is here. He clearly saw that that was a moment, that was an inflection point that he could do something with. 
The next phase it hit was displacement. 
You can see around 2001 it finally out-sold the VCR. 
And here too, you can see the implications in the world at large. 
Netflix was right -- the Netflix model could capitalize on the DVD in a way that the video-rental stores couldn't. 
Among the DVD's many assets is that it's very small; you can stick it in the mailer and post it cheaply. 
That gave an advantage; that was an implication of the technology's rise that wasn't obvious to everybody. 
And then finally, DVDs are approaching free. 
There's a company called Apex, a no-name Chinese firm, who has, several times in the past year, been the number-one DVD seller in America. Their average price, for last year, was 48 dollars. 
You're aware of the perhaps apocryphal Wal-Mart stampede over the 30-dollar DVD. 
But they're getting very, very cheap, and look at the interesting implication of it. As they get cheaper, the premium brands, the Sonys and such, are losing market share, and the no-names, the Apexes, are gaining them. 
They're being commodified, and that's what happens when things go to zero. It's a tough market out there. 
 Now they've introduced these four ways of looking at technology, these four stages of technology's life. 
I'd like to talk about some other technologies out there, just technologies on our radar -- and I'll use this lens, these four, as a way to kind of tell you where each one of those technologies is in its development. 
They're not necessarily the top-10 technologies out there -- they're just examples of technologies that are in each one of these periods. 
But I think that the implications of them approaching these crossovers, these intersections, are interesting to think about. 
Start with gene sequencing. 
As you probably know, gene sequencing -- in a large part, because it's built on computers -- is falling in price at a kind of a Moore's Law-like level. 
It is now possible -- will be possible, and if Craig Venter indeed comes today, he may tell you something about this -- to sequence the human genome for 40 million dollars by the end of this year. 
That's as opposed to billions just a few years ago. 
You know, our ability to capture the tools of creation is getting closer and closer. 
What's interesting is that at the same time, the number of genes that we're discovering is rising very quickly. 
Each one of these genes has potential diagnostic test. 
There will come a day when you can have hundreds of thousands of tests done, very cheaply, if you want to know. You can learn about your own mosaic. 
Here's another technology that's approaching a critical price. 
This is a fascinating research from WHO that shows the effect of generic drugs on anti-retroviral drug compounds and cocktails. 
In January 2000, the price was 10,000 dollars, or 27 dollars a day. 
The generics came in, first in Brazil and elsewhere, and the effect was just dramatic on pricing. 
Today it's less than 50 cents a day. 
And what's interesting is if you look at the price elasticity, if you look at the correlation between these two, as the anti-retrovirals come down, the number of people you can treat goes radically up. And the Clinton Foundation and WHO believe that they can treat three million people worldwide by 2005 -- two million in sub-Saharan Africa. 
And the falling price of drugs has a lot to do with that. 
Linux is another good example. 
Now we've switched to critical mass. 
These are now technologies that are hitting critical mass. 
If you look here, here's Linux in red, and it's hit 20 percent. 
Interestingly, it's done a crossover before, but not the crossovers that matter. 
The crossover that's going to matter is the one with the blue. 
But you can look and see the direction those lines are going, you can see that at the 20 percent, it's now taken seriously. 
It's not just for the geeks any more. 
That is, I imagine, what people in Redmond wake up in the middle of the night thinking about. 
 Another technology that we see all around us out here is hybrid cars. 
I don't know whether anybody has a Prius 2004, but they're fantastic. 
And if you look at the trends here, by about 2008 -- and I don't think this is a crazy forecast -- they'll be two percent of auto sales. 
Two percent isn't 20 percent, but in the car business, which is slow moving, that's huge; that's arrival. 
At two percent, you start seeing them on the roads everywhere. 
And what's interesting about the hybrids taking off is you've now introduced electric motors to the automobile industry. 
It's the first radical change in automobile technology in 100 years. 
And once you have electric motors, you can do anything: you can change the structure of the car in any way you want. 
You can have regenerative braking; you can have drive-by-wire; you can have replaceable body shapes -- it's a little thing that starts with a hybrid, but it can lead to a whole new era of the car. 
Voice Over IP is something you may have heard something about. 
Again, it's kind of coming out of nowhere; it's a little hard to use right now. 
There's a company created by the Kazaa founders called Skype. 
Look at these numbers. They launched it in August of last year; they already have nearly four million registered users -- that's critical mass. 
And the same thing's happening on the carrier side. 
You're looking at IP taking over from some of the traditional telecom standards. This is a tipping point -- if Malcolm's here, forgive me -- and it's going to change the economics, and the speed, and the players in the industry. 
It's going to look a little bit like that. 
And finally, free. Free is really, really interesting. 
Free is something that comes with digital, because the reproduction costs are essentially free. It comes with IP, because it's such an efficient protocol. It comes with fiber optics, because there's so much bandwidth. 
Free is really, you know, the gift of Silicon Valley to the world. 
It's an economic force; it's a technical force. 
It's a deflationary force, if not handled right. 
It is abundance, as opposed to scarcity. 
Free is probably the most interesting thing. 
And here you have just the number of songs that can be stored on a hard drive. 
You know, there could be a film's [unclear] there, but it's basically, every song ever made could be stored on 400 dollars worth of storage by 2008. It takes that entire element, the physical element, of songs off the table. 
And you've seen the numbers. 
I mean, you know, the music industry is imploding in front of our very eyes, and Hollywood's worried as well. 
They're facing a force that they haven't faced before. 
And their response is draconian, and not necessarily the one that's going to get them out of this. 
And finally, I'll give you one last example of free -- perhaps the most powerful of all. I mentioned fiber optics -- their abundance tends to make things free. 
This is the price of a phone call to India per minute. 
And what's interesting is that it was just 1990 when it was more than two dollars a minute. 
India had, still has, a regulated phone system and so did we. 
It was surprisingly non-innovative, moved very slowly, but then there was just so much fiber out there, you couldn't hold back, and look how quickly the price fell. 
It's seven cents a minute, in many cases. 
And the consequence of cheap phone calling, free phone calling, to India, is the pissed-off programmer, is the outsourcing. 
It is probably one of the most dramatic shifts in globalization and one of the most powerful economic tools that we're seeing in our world today. 
The force of India, and then China, and any other country that can contact our markets and will work with our companies -- because the communications are free -- is just beginning to be felt. 
And I think that's probably one of the most important technology trends that we're looking at today. 
Thank you.

<title>Alex Steffen: The route to a sustainable future</title> 
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Worldchanging.com founder Alex Steffen argues that reducing humanity’s ecological footprint is incredibly vital now, as the western consumer lifestyle spreads to developing countries.</description> 
When I'm starting talks like this, I usually do a whole spiel about sustainability because a lot of people out there don't know what that is. 
This is a crowd that does know what it is, so I'll like just do like the 60-second crib-note version. Right? 
So just bear with me. We'll go real fast, you know? 
Fill in the blanks. 
So, you know, sustainability, small planet. 
Right? Picture a little Earth, circling around the sun. 
You know, about a million years ago, a bunch of monkeys fell out of trees, got a little clever, harnessed fire, invented the printing press, made, you know, luggage with wheels on it. 
And, you know, built the society that we now live in. 
Unfortunately, while this society is, without a doubt, the most prosperous and dynamic the world has ever created, it's got some major, major flaws. 
One of them is that every society has an ecological footprint. 
It has an amount of impact on the planet that's measurable. 
How much stuff goes through your life, how much waste is left behind you. 
And we, at the moment, in our society, have a really dramatically unsustainable level of this. 
We're using up about five planets. 
If everybody on the planet lived the way we did, we'd need between five, six, seven, some people even say 10 planets to make it. 
Clearly we don't have 10 planets. 
Again, you know, mental, visual, 10 planets, one planet, 10 planets, one planet. Right? 
We don't have that. So that's one problem. 
The second problem is that the planet that we have is being used in wildly unfair ways. Right? 
North Americans, such as myself, you know, we're basically sort of wallowing, gluttonous hogs, and we're eating all sorts of stuff. 
And, you know, then you get all the way down to people who live in the Asia-Pacific region, or even more, Africa. 
And people simply do not have enough to survive. 
This is producing all sorts of tensions, all sorts of dynamics that are deeply disturbing. 
And there's more and more people on the way. Right? 
So, this is what the planet's going to look like in 20 years. 
It's going to be a pretty crowded place, at least eight billion people. 
So to make matters even more difficult, it's a very young planet. 
A third of the people on this planet are kids. 
And those kids are growing up in a completely different way than their parents did, no matter where they live. 
They've been exposed to this idea of our society, of our prosperity. 
And they may not want to live exactly like us. 
They may not want to be Americans, or Brits, or Germans, or South Africans, but they want their own version of a life which is more prosperous, and more dynamic, and more, you know, enjoyable. 
And all of these things combine to create an enormous amount of torque on the planet. 
And if we cannot figure out a way to deal with that torque, we are going to find ourselves more and more and more quickly facing situations which are simply unthinkable. 
Everybody in this room has heard the worst-case scenarios. 
I don't need to go into that. 
But I will ask the question, what's the alternative? 
And I would say that, at the moment, the alternative is unimaginable. 
You know, so on the one hand we have the unthinkable; on the other hand we have the unimaginable. 
We don't know yet how to build a society which is environmentally sustainable, which is shareable with everybody on the planet, which promotes stability and democracy and human rights, and which is achievable in the time-frame necessary to make it through the challenges we face. 
We don't know how to do this yet. 
So what's Worldchanging? 
Well, Worldchanging you might think of as being a bit of a news service for the unimaginable future. 
You know, what we're out there doing is looking for examples of tools, models and ideas, which, if widely adopted, would change the game. 
A lot of times, when I do a talk like this, I talk about things that everybody in this room I'm sure has already heard of, but most people haven't. 
So I thought today I'd do something a little different, and talk about what we're looking for, rather than saying, you know, rather than giving you tried-and-true examples. 
Talk about the kinds of things we're scoping out. 
Give you a little peek into our editorial notebook. 
And given that I have 13 minutes to do this, this is going to go kind of quick. 
So, I don't know, just stick with me. Right? 
So, first of all, what are we looking for? Bright Green city. 
One of the biggest levers that we have in the developed world for changing the impact that we have on the planet is changing the way that we live in cities. 
We're already an urban planet; that's especially true in the developed world. 
And people who live in cities in the developed world tend to be very prosperous, and thus use a lot of stuff. 
If we can change the dynamic, by first of all creating cities that are denser and more livable ... 
Here, for example, is Vancouver, which if you haven't been there, you ought to go for a visit. It's a fabulous city. 
And they are doing density, new density, better than probably anybody else on the planet right now. 
They're actually managing to talk North Americans out of driving cars, which is a pretty great thing. 
So you have density. You also have growth management. 
You leave aside what is natural to be natural. 
This is in Portland. That is an actual development. 
That land there will remain pasture in perpetuity. 
They've bounded the city with a line. 
Nature, city. Nothing changes. 
Once you do those things, you can start making all sorts of investments. 
You can start doing things like, you know, transit systems that actually work to transport people, in effective and reasonably comfortable manners. 
You can also start to change what you build. 
This is the Beddington Zero Energy Development in London, which is one of the greenest buildings in the world. It's a fabulous place. 
We're able to now build buildings that generate all their own electricity, that recycle much of their water, that are much more comfortable than standard buildings, use all-natural light, etc., and, over time, cost less. 
Green roofs. Bill McDonough covered that last night, so I won't dwell on that too much. 
But once you also have people living in close proximity to each other, one of the things you can do is -- as information technologies develop -- you can start to have smart places. 
You can start to know where things are. 
When you know where things are, it becomes easier to share them. 
When you share them, you end up using less. 
So one great example is car-share clubs, which are really starting to take off in the U.S., have already taken off in many places in Europe, and are a great example. 
If you're somebody who drives, you know, one day a week, do you really need your own car? 
Another thing that information technology lets us do is start figuring out how to use less stuff by knowing, and by monitoring, the amount we're actually using. 
So, here's a power cord which glows brighter the more energy that you use, which I think is a pretty cool concept, although I think it ought to work the other way around, that it gets brighter the more you don't use. 
But, you know, there may even be a simpler approach. 
We could just re-label things. 
This light switch that reads, on the one hand, flashfloods, and on the other hand, off. 
How we build things can change as well. 
This is a bio-morphic building. 
It takes its inspiration in form from life. 
Many of these buildings are incredibly beautiful, and also much more effective. 
This is an example of bio-mimicry, which is something we're really starting to look a lot more for. 
In this case, you have a shell design which was used to create a new kind of exhaust fan, which is greatly more effective. 
There's a lot of this stuff happening; it's really pretty remarkable. 
I encourage you to look on Worldchanging if you're into it. 
We're starting to cover this more and more. 
There's also neo-biological design, where more and more we're actually using life itself and the processes of life to become part of our industry. 
So this, for example, is hydrogen-generating algae. 
So we have a model in potential, an emerging model that we're looking for of how to take the cities most of us live in, and turn them into Bright Green cities. 
But unfortunately, most of the people on the planet don't live in the cites we live in. 
They live in the emerging megacities of the developing world. 
And there's a statistic I often like to use, which is that we're adding a city of Seattle every four days, a city the size of Seattle to the planet every four days. 
I was giving a talk about two months ago, and this guy, who'd done some work with the U.N., came up to me and was really flustered, and he said, look, you've got that totally wrong; it's totally wrong. 
It's every seven days. 
So, we're adding a city the size of Seattle every seven days, and most of those cities look more like this than the city that you or I live in. 
Most of those cites are growing incredibly quickly. 
They don't have existing infrastructure; they have enormous numbers of people who are struggling with poverty, and enormous numbers of people are trying to figure out how to do things in new ways. 
So what do we need in order to make developing nation megacities into Bright Green megacities? 
Well, the first thing we need is, we need leapfrogging. 
And this is one of the things that we are looking for everywhere. 
The idea behind leapfrogging is that if you are a person, or a country, who is stuck in a situation where you don't have the tools and technologies that you need, there's no reason for you to invest in last generation's technologies. Right? 
That you're much better off, almost universally, looking for a low-cost or locally applicable version of the newest technology. 
One place we're all familiar with seeing this is with cell phones. Right? 
All throughout the developing world, people are going directly to cell phones, skipping the whole landline stage. 
If there are landlines in many developing world cities, they're usually pretty crappy systems that break down a lot and cost enormous amounts of money. 
So I rather like this picture here. 
I particularly like the Ganesh in the background, talking on the cell phone. 
So what we have, increasingly, is cell phones just permeating out through society. 
We've heard all about this here this week, so I won't say too much more than that, other than to say what is true for cell phones is true for all sorts of technologies. 
The second thing is tools for collaboration, be they systems of collaboration, or intellectual property systems which encourage collaboration. Right? 
When you have free ability for people to freely work together and innovate, you get different kinds of solutions. 
And those solutions are accessible in a different way to people who don't have capital. Right? 
So, you know, we have open source software, we have Creative Commons and other kinds of Copyleft solutions. 
And those things lead to things like this. 
This is a Telecentro in Sao Paulo. 
This is a pretty remarkable program using free and open source software, cheap, sort of hacked-together machines, and basically sort of abandoned buildings -- has put together a bunch of community centers where people can come in, get high-speed internet access, learn computer programming skills for free. 
And a quarter-million people every year use these now in Sao Paulo. 
And those quarter-million people are some of the poorest people in Sao Paolo. 
I particularly like the little Linux penguin in the back.  So one of the things that that's leading to is a sort of southern cultural explosion. 
And one of the things we're really, really interested in at Worldchanging is the ways in which the south is re-identifying itself, and re-categorizing itself in ways that have less and less to do with most of us in this room. 
So it's not, you know, Bollywood isn't just answering Hollywood. Right? 
You know, Brazilian music scene isn't just answering the major labels. 
It's doing something new. There's new things happening. 
There's interplay between them. And, you know, you get amazing things. 
Like, I don't know if any of you have seen the movie "City of God?" 
Yeah, it's a fabulous movie if you haven't seen it. 
And it's all about this question, in a very artistic and indirect kind of way. 
You have other radical examples where the ability to use cultural tools is spreading out. 
These are people who have just been visited by the Internet bookmobile in Uganda. 
And who are waving their first books in the air, which, I just think that's a pretty cool picture. You know? 
So you also have the ability for people to start coming together and acting on their own behalf in political and civic ways, in ways that haven't happened before. 
And as we heard last night, as we've heard earlier this week, are absolutely, fundamentally vital to the ability to craft new solutions, is we've got to craft new political realities. 
And I would personally say that we have to craft new political realities, not only in places like India, Afghanistan, Kenya, Pakistan, what have you, but here at home as well. 
Another world is possible. 
And sort of the big motto of the anti-globalization movement. Right? 
We tweak that a lot. 
We talk about how another world isn't just possible; another world's here. 
That it's not just that we have to sort of imagine there being a different, vague possibility out there, but we need to start acting a little bit more on that possibility. 
We need to start doing things like Lula, President of Brazil. 
How many people knew of Lula before today? 
OK, so, much, much better than the average crowd, I can tell you that. 
So Lula, he's full of problems, full of contradictions, but one of the things that he's doing is, he is putting forward an idea of how we engage in international relations that completely shifts the balance from the standard sort of north-south dialogue into a whole new way of global collaboration. 
I would keep your eye on this fellow. 
Another example of this sort of second superpower thing is the rise of these games that are what we call "serious play." 
We're looking a lot at this. This is spreading everywhere. 
This is from "A Force More Powerful." It's a little screenshot. 
"A Force More Powerful" is a video game that, while you're playing it, it teaches you how to engage in non-violent insurrection and regime change.  Here's another one. This is from a game called "Food Force," which is a game that teaches children how to run a refugee camp. 
These things are all contributing in a very dynamic way to a huge rise in, especially in the developing world, in people's interest in and passion for democracy. 
We get so little news about the developing world that we often forget that there are literally millions of people out there struggling to change things to be fairer, freer, more democratic, less corrupt. 
And, you know, we don't hear those stories enough. 
But it's happening all over the place, and these tools are part of what's making it possible. 
Now when you add all those things together, when you add together leapfrogging and new kinds of tools, you know, second superpower stuff, etc., what do you get? 
Well, very quickly, you get a Bright Green future for the developing world. 
You get, for example, green power spread throughout the world. 
You get -- this is a building in Hyderabad, India. 
It's the greenest building in the world. 
You get grassroots solutions, things that work for people who have no capital or limited access. 
You get barefoot solar engineers carrying solar panels into the remote mountains. 
You get access to distance medicine. 
These are Indian nurses learning how to use PDAs to access databases that have information that they don't have access to at home in a distant manner. 
You get new tools for people in the developing world. 
These are LED lights that help the roughly billion people out there, for whom nightfall means darkness, to have a new means of operating. 
These are refrigerators that require no electricity; they're pot within a pot design. 
And you get water solutions. Water's one of the most pressing problems. 
Here's a design for harvesting rainwater that's super cheap and available to people in the developing world. 
Here's a design for distilling water using sunlight. 
Here's a fog-catcher, which, if you live in a moist, jungle-like area, will distill water from the air that's clean and drinkable. 
Here's a way of transporting water. 
I just love this, you know -- I mean carrying water is such a drag, and somebody just came up with the idea of well, what if you rolled it. Right? 
I mean, that's a great design. 
This is a fabulous invention, LifeStraw. 
Basically you can suck any water through this and it will become drinkable by the time it hits your lips. 
So, you know, people who are in desperate straits can get this. 
This is one of my favorite Worldchanging kinds of things ever. 
This is a merry-go-round invented by the company Roundabout, which pumps water as kids play. You know? 
Seriously -- give that one a hand, it's pretty great. 
And the same thing is true for people who are in absolute crisis. Right? 
We're expecting to have upwards of 200 million refugees by the year 2020 because of climate change and political instability. 
How do we help people like that? 
Well, there's all sorts of amazing new humanitarian designs that are being developed in collaborative ways all across the planet. 
Some of those designs include models for acting, such as new models for village instruction in the middle of refugee camps. 
New models for pedagogy for the displaced. 
And we have new tools. 
This is one of my absolute favorite things anywhere. 
Does anyone know what this is? 
Audience: It detects landmines. 
Alex Steffen: Exactly, this is a landmine-detecting flower. 
If you are living in one of the places where the roughly half-billion unaccounted for mines are scattered, you can fling these seeds out into the field. 
And as they grow up, they will grow up around the mines, their roots will detect the chemicals in them, and where the flowers turn red you don't step. 
Yeah, so seeds that could save your life. You know? 
 I also love it because it seems to me that the example, the tools we use to change the world, ought to be beautiful in themselves. 
You know, that it's not just enough to survive. 
We've got to make something better than what we've got. 
And I think that we will. 
Just to wrap up, in the immortal words of H.G. Wells, I think that better things are on the way. 
I think that, in fact, that "all of the past is but the beginning of a beginning. 
All that the human mind has accomplished is but the dream before the awakening." 
I hope that that turns out to be true. 
The people in this room have given me more confidence than ever that it will. 
Thank you very much.

<title>Susan Savage-Rumbaugh: The gentle genius of bonobos</title> 
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Savage-Rumbaugh's work with bonobo apes, which can understand spoken language and learn tasks by watching, forces the audience to rethink how much of what a species can do is determined by biology -- and how much by cultural exposure.</description> 
I work with a species called "Bonobo." 
And I'm happy most of the time, because I think this is the happiest species on the planet. 
It's kind of a well-kept secret. 
This species lives only in the Congo. 
And they're not in too many zoos, because of their sexual behavior. 
Their sexual behavior is too human-like for most of us to be comfortable with. 
 But --  actually, we have a lot to learn from them, because they're a very egalitarian society and they're a very empathetic society. 
And sexual behavior is not confined to one aspect of their life that they sort of set aside. 
It permeates their entire life. 
And it's used for communication. 
And it's used for conflict resolution. 
And I think perhaps somewhere in our history we sort of, divided our lives up into lots of parts. 
We divided our world up with lots of categories. 
And so everything sort of has a place that it has to fit. 
But I don't think that we were that way initially. 
There are many people who think that the animal world is hard-wired and that there's something very, very special about man. 
Maybe it's his ability to have causal thought. 
Maybe it's something special in his brain that allows him to have language. 
Maybe it's something special in his brain that allows him to make tools or to have mathematics. 
Well, I don't know. There were Tasmanians who were discovered around the 1600s and they had no fire. 
They had no stone tools. 
To our knowledge they had no music. 
So when you compare them to the Bonobo, the Bonobo is a little hairier. 
He doesn't stand quite as upright. 
But there are a lot of similarities. 
And I think that as we look at culture, we kind of come to understand how we got to where we are. 
And I don't really think it's in our biology; I think we've attributed it to our biology, but I don't really think it's there. 
So what I want to do now is introduce you to a species called the Bonobo. 
This is Kanzi. 
He's a Bonobo. 
Right now, he's in a forest in Georgia. 
His mother originally came from a forest in Africa. 
And she came to us when she was just at puberty, about six or seven years of age. 
Now this shows a Bonobo on your right, and a chimpanzee on your left. 
Clearly, the chimpanzee has a little bit harder time of walking. 
The Bonobo, although shorter than us and their arms still longer, is more upright, just as we are. 
This shows the Bonobo compared to an australopithecine like Lucy. 
As you can see, there's not a lot of difference between the way a Bonobo walks and the way an early australopithecine would have walked. 
As they turn toward us you'll see that the pelvic area of early australopithecines is a little flatter and doesn't have to rotate quite so much from side to side. 
So the -- the bipedal gait is a little easier. 
And now we see all four. 
Video: Narrator: The wild Bonobo lives in central Africa, in the jungle encircled by the Congo River. 
Canopied trees as tall as 40 meters, 130 feet, grow densely in the area. 
It was a Japanese scientist who first undertook serious field studies of the Bonobo, almost three decades ago. 
Bonobos are built slightly smaller than the chimpanzee. 
Slim-bodied, Bonobos are by nature very gentle creatures. 
Long and careful studies have reported many new findings on them. 
One discovery was that wild Bonobos often walk bidpedally. 
What's more, they are able to walk upright for long distances. 
Susan Savage-Rumbaugh : Let's go say hello to Austin first and then go to the A frame. 
SS: This is Kanzi and I, in the forest. 
None of the things you will see in this particular video are trained. 
None of them are tricks. 
They all happened to be captured on film spontaneously, by NHK of Japan. 
We have eight Bonobos. 
Video: Look at all this stuff that's here for our campfire. 
SS: An entire family at our research centre. 
Video: You going to help get some sticks? 
Good. 
We need more sticks, too. 
I have a lighter in my pocket if you need one. 
That's a wasps' nest. 
You can get it out. 
I hope I have a lighter. 
You can use the lighter to start the fire. 
SS: So Kanzi is very interested in fire. 
He doesn't do it yet without a lighter, but I think if he saw someone do it, he might be able to do -- make a fire without a lighter. 
He's learning about how to keep a fire going. 
He's learning the uses for a fire, just by watching what we do with fire. 
 This is a smile on the face of a Bonobo. 
These are happy vocalizations. 
Video: You're happy. 
You're very happy about this part. 
You've got to put some water on the fire. You see the water? 
Good job. 
SS: Forgot to zip up the back half of his backpack. 
But he likes to carry things from place to place. 
Video: Austin, I hear you saying "Austin." 
SS: He talks to other Bonobos at the lab, long-distance, farther than we can hear. 
This is his sister. 
This is her first time to try to drive a golf cart. 
Video: Goodbye. 
 SS: She's got the pedals down, but not the wheel. 
She switches from reverse to forward and she holds onto the wheel, rather than turns it. 
 Like us, she knows that that individual in the mirror is her. 
 Video: Narrator: By raising Bonobos in a culture that is both Bonobo and human, and documenting their development across two decades, scientists are exploring how cultural forces  may have operated during human evolution. 
His name is Nyota. 
It means "star" in Swahili. 
 Panbanisha is trying to give Nyota a haircut with a pair of scissors. 
In the wild, the parent Bonobo is known to groom its offspring. 
Here Panbanisha uses scissors, instead of her hands, to groom Nyota. 
Very impressive. 
Subtle maneuvering of the hands is required to perform delicate tasks like this. 
Nyota tries to imitate Panbanisha by using the scissors himself. 
Realizing that Nyota might get hurt, Panbanisha, like any human mother, carefully tugs to get the scissors back. 
He can now cut through tough animal hide. 
SS: Kanzi's learned to make stone tools. 
Video: Kanzi now makes his tools, just as our ancestors may have made them, two-and-a-half million years ago -- by holding the rocks in both hands, to strike one against the other. 
He has learned that by using both hands and aiming his glancing blows, he can make much larger, sharper flakes. 
Kanzi chooses a flake he thinks is sharp enough. 
The tough hide is difficult to cut, even with a knife. 
The rock that Kanzi is using is extremely hard and ideal for stone tool making, but difficult to handle, requiring great skill. 
Kanzi's rock is from Gona, Ethiopia and is identical to that used by our African ancestors two-and-a-half million years ago. 
These are the rocks Kanzi used and these are the flakes he made. 
The flat sharp edges are like knife blades. 
Compare them to the tools our ancestors used; they bear a striking resemblance to Kanzi's. 
Panbanisha is longing to go for a walk in the woods. 
She keeps staring out the window. 
SS: This is -- let me show you something we didn't think they would do. 
Video: For several days now, Panbanisha has not been outside. 
SS: I normally talk about language. 
Video: Then Panbanisha does something unexpected. 
SS: But since I'm advised not to do what I normally do, I haven't told you that these apes have language. 
It's a geometric language. 
Video: She takes a piece of chalk and begins writing something on the floor. 
What is she writing? 
SS: She's also saying the name of that, with her voice. 
Video: Now she comes up to Dr. Sue and starts writing again. 
SS: These are her symbols on her keyboard. 
 They speak when she touches them. 
Video: Panbanisha is communicating to Dr. Sue where she wants to go. 
"A frame" represents a hut in the woods. 
Compare the chalk writing with the lexigram on the keyboard. 
Panbanisha began writing the lexigrams on the forest floor. 
SS : Very nice. Beautiful, Panbanisha. 
SS: At first we didn't really realize what she was doing, until we stood back and looked at it and rotated it. 
Video: This lexigram also refers to a place in the woods. 
The curved line is very similar to the lexigram. 
The next symbol Panbanisha writes represents "collar." 
It indicates the collar that Panbanisha must wear when she goes out. 
SS: That's an institutional requirement. 
Video: This symbol is not as clear as the others, but one can see Panbanisha is trying to produce a curved line and several straight lines. 
Researchers began to record what Panbanisha said, by writing lexigrams on the floor with chalk. 
Panbanisha watched. 
Soon she began to write as well. 
The Bonobo's abilities have stunned scientists around the world. 
How did they develop? 
SS : We found that the most important thing for permitting Bonobos to acquire language is not to teach them. 
It's simply to use language around them, because the driving force in language acquisition is to understand what others, that are important to you, are saying to you. 
Once you have that capacity, the ability to produce language comes rather naturally and rather freely. 
So we want to create an environment in which Bonobos, like all of the individuals with whom they are interacting -- we want to create an environment in which they have fun, and an environment in which the others are meaningful individuals for them. 
Narrator: This environment brings out unexpected potential in Kanzi and Panbanisha. 
Panbanisha is enjoying playing her harmonica, until Nyota, now one year old, steals it. 
Then he peers eagerly into his mother's mouth. 
Is he looking for where the sound came from? 
Dr. Sue thinks it's important to allow such curiosity to flourish. 
This time Panbanisha is playing the electric piano. 
She wasn't forced to learn the piano; she saw a researcher play the instrument and took an interest. 
Researcher: Go ahead. Go ahead. I'm listening. 
Do that real fast part that you did. Yeah, that part. 
Narrator: Kanzi plays the xylophone; using both hands he enthusiastically accompanies Dr. Sue's singing. 
Kanzi and Panbanisha are stimulated by this fun-filled environment, which promotes the emergence of these cultural capabilities. 
 Researcher: OK, now get the monsters. Get them. 
Take the cherries too. 
Now watch out, stay away from them now. 
Now you can chase them again. Time to chase them. 
Now you have to stay away. Get away. 
Run away. Run. 
Now we can chase them again. Go get them. 
Oh no! 
Good Kanzi. Very good. Thank you so much. 
Narrator: None of us, Bonobo or human, can possibly even imagine? 
SS: So we have a bi-species environment, we call it a "panhomoculture." 
We're learning how to become like them. 
We're learning how to communicate with them, in really high-pitched tones. 
We're learning that they probably have a language in the wild. 
And they're learning to become like us. 
Because we believe that it's not biology; it's culture. 
So we're sharing tools and technology and language with another species. 
Thank you.

<title>Al Seckel: Visual illusions that show how we think</title> 
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Al Seckel, a cognitive neuroscientist, explores the perceptual illusions that fool our brains. Loads of eye tricks help him prove that not only are we easily fooled, we kind of like it.</description> 
We're going to talk -- my -- a new lecture, just for TED -- and I'm going show you some illusions that we've created for TED, and I'm going to try to relate this to happiness. What I was thinking about with happiness is, what gives happiness -- or happiness, which I equate with joy in my particular area, and I think there's something very 
fundamental. And I was thinking about this. And it's in terms of both illusions and movies that we go see and jokes and magic shows is that there's something about these things where our expectations are violated in some sort of pleasing way. You go see a movie. And it has an unexpected twist -- something that you didn't expect -- and 
you find a joyful experience. You look at those sort of illusions in my book and it's not as what you'd expect. And there's something joyful about it. And it's the same thing with jokes and all these sorts of things. So, what I'm going to try and do in my lecture is go a little bit further 
and see if I can violate your expectations in a pleasing way. I mean, sometimes expectations that are violated are not pleasant, but I'm going to try to do it in a pleasant way, in a very primal way, so I can make the audience here happy. 
So I'm going to show you some ways that we can violate your expectations. First of all, I want to show you the particular illusion here. I want you first of all when it pops up on the screen to notice that the two holes are perpendicular to each other. These are all perceptual tricks. These are real objects that I'm going to show you. Now 
I'm going to show you how it is done. I've looped the film here so you can get a very interesting experience. I want you to see how this illusion is constructed, and it's going to rotate so you see that it's inside out. Now watch, as it rotates back, how quickly your perception snaps. OK now. 
Watch it as it rotates back again. And this is a very bright audience, all right? See if you can stop it from happening, even though you know 100 percent it's true that -- bam! You can't undo it. What does that tell you about yourselves? We're going to do it again. No doubt about it. See if you can stop 
it from happening. No. It's difficult. 
And we can violate your expectations in a whole variety of ways about representation, about shape, about color and so forth and it's very primal. And it's an interesting question to ponder, why these things -- we find these things joyful. Why would we find them joyful? So, here's something that Lionel did a while ago. I like these sort of 
little things like this. 
Again, this is not an optical trick. This is what you would see. In other words, it's not a camera cut. It's a perceptual trick. 
OK. We can violate your expectations about shape. 
We can violate your expectations on representation -- what an image represents. What do you see here? 
How many of you here see dolphins? Raise your hand if you see dolphins. OK, those people who raised their hands, afterwards, the rest of the audience, go talk to them, all right? Actually, this is the best example of priming by experience that I know. 
If you are a child under the age of 10 who haven't been ruined yet, you will look at this image and see dolphins. Now, some of you adults here are saying, "What dolphins? What dolphins?" 
But in fact, if you reversed the figure ground -- in other words, the dark areas here -- I forgot to ask for a pointer -- but if you reverse it, you'll see a whole series of little dolphins. By the way, if you're also a student at CalTech -- they also tend to just see the dolphins. It's based on 
experience. 
Now, something like this can be used because this is after all talk about design, too. This was done by Saatchi and Saatchi, and they actually got away with this ad in Australia. So, if you look at this ad for beer, all those people are in sort of provocative positions. But they got it passed, and actually won the Clio awards, so it's funny how you can do 
these things. 
Remember that sort of, um. This is the joke I did when the Florida ballot was going around. You know, count the dots for Gore; count the dots for Bush; count 'em again ... 
You can violate your expectations about experience. Here is an outside water fountain that I created with some friends of mine, but you can stop the water in drops and -- actually make all the drops levitate. This is something we're building for, you know, amusement parks and that kind of stuff. 
Now let's take a static image. Can you see this? 
Do you see the middle section moving down and the outer sections moving up? It's completely static. 
It's a static image. How many people see this illusion? It's completely static. 
Right. Now, when -- it's interesting that when we look at an image we see, you know, color, depth, texture. And you can look at this whole scene and analyze it. You can see the woman is in closer than the wall and so forth. But the whole thing is actually flat. It's painted. It's trompe l'oeil. 
And it was such a good trompe l'oeil that people got irritated when they tried to talk to the woman and she wouldn't respond. 
Now, you can make design mistakes. Like this building in New York. So that when you see it from this side, it looks like the balconies tilt up, and when you walk around to the other side it looks like the balconies go down. So there are cases where you have mistakes in design that incorporate illusions. 
Or, you take this particular un-retouched photograph. Now, interestingly enough, I get a lot of emails from people who say, "Is there any perceptual difference between males and females?" 
And I really say, "No." I mean, women can navigate through the world just as well as males can -- and why wouldn't they? However, this is the one illusion that women can consistently do better than males: in matching which head because they rely on fashion cues. They can match the hat. 
Okay, now getting to a part -- I want to show design in illusions. I believe that the first example of illusions being used purposely was by da Vinci in this anamorphic image of an eye. So that when you saw from one little angle was like this. And this little technique got popular in the 16th century and the 17th century to disguise 
hidden meanings, where you could flip the image and see it from one little point of view like this. 
But these are early incorporations of illusions brought to -- sort of high point with Hans Holbein's "Ambassadors." And Hans Holbein worked for Henry VIII. This was hung on a wall where you could walk down from the stair and you can see this hidden skull. 
All right, now I'm going to show you some designers who work with illusions to give that element of surprise. One of my favorites is Scott Kim. I worked with Scott to create some illusions for TED that I hope you will enjoy. We have one here on TED and happiness. 
OK now. Arthur [Ganson] hasn't talked yet, but his is going to be a delightful talk and he has some of his really fantastic machines outside. And so, we -- Scott created this wonderful tribute to Arthur Ganson. 
Well, there's analog and digital. Thought that was appropriate here. 
And figure goes to ground. 
And for the musicians. 
And of course, since happiness -- we want "joy to the world." 
Now, another great designer -- he's very well known in Japan -- Shigeo Fukuda. And he just builds some fantastic things. This is simply amazing. This is a pile of junk that when you view it from one particular angle, you see its reflection in the mirror as a perfect piano. 
Pianist transforms to violinist. 
This is really wild. This assemblage of forks, knives and spoons and various cutlery, welded together. It gives a shadow of a motorcycle. You learn something in the sort of thing that I do, which is there are people out there with a lot of time on their hands. 
Ken Knowlton does wonderful composite images, like creating Jacques Cousteau out of seashells -- un-retouched seashells, but just by rearranging them. He did Einstein out of dice because, after all, Einstein said, "God does not play dice with the universe." Bert Herzog out of un-retouched keyboards. Will Shortz, crossword puzzle. John Cederquist does these wonderful trompe l'oeil cabinets. 
Now, I'm going to skip ahead since I'm sort of running [behind]. I want to show you quickly what I've created, some new type of illusions. I've done something with taking the Pixar-type illusions. So you see these kids the same size here, running down the hall. The two table tops of the same size. 
They're looking out two directions at once. You have a larger piece fitting in with a smaller. And that's something for you to think about, all right? So you see larger pieces fitting in within smaller pieces here. Does everyone see that? Which is impossible. You can see the two kids are looking out simultaneously out of two different 
directions at once. Now can you believe these two table tops are the same size and shape? They are. 
So, if you measured them, they would be. And as I say, those two figures are identical in size and shape. 
And it's interesting, by doing this in this sort of rendered fashion, how much stronger the illusions are. Any case, I hope this has brought you a little joy and happiness, and if you're interested in seeing more cool effects, see me outside. I'd be happy to show you lots of things.

<title>Dean Kamen: Luke, a new prosthetic arm for soldiers</title> 
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Inventor Dean Kamen previews the prosthetic arm he’s developing at the request of the US Department of Defense. His quiet commitment to using technology to solve problems -- while honoring the human spirit -- has never been more clear.</description> 
I got a visit almost exactly a year ago, a little over a year ago, from a very senior person at the Department of Defense. 
Came to see me and said, "1,600 of the kids that we've sent out have come back missing at least one full arm. 
Whole arm. Shoulder disarticulation. 
And we're doing the same thing we did for -- more or less, that we've done since the Civil War, a stick and a hook. 
And they deserve more than that." 
And literally, this guy sat in my office in New Hampshire and said, "I want you to give me something that we can put on these kids that'll pick up a raisin or a grape off a table, they'll be able to put it in their mouth without destroying either one, and they'll be able to know the difference without looking at it." 
You know, had efferent, afferent, and haptic response. 
He finishes explaining that, and I'm waiting for the big 300 pound paper proposal, and he said, "That's what I want from you." 
I said, "Look, you're nuts. That technology's just not available right now. 
And it can't be done. 
Not in an envelope of a human arm, with 21 degrees of freedom, from your shoulder to your fingertips." 
He said, "About two dozen of these 1,600 kids have come back bilateral. 
You think it's bad to lose one arm? 
That's an inconvenience compared to having both of them gone." 
I got a day job, and my nights and weekends are already filled up with things like, let's supply water to the world, and power to the world, and educate all the kids, which, Chris, I will not talk about. I don't need another mission. 
I keep thinking about these kids with no arms. 
He says to me, "We've done some work around the country. 
We've got some pretty amazing neurology and other people." 
I said, "I'll take a field trip, I'll go see what you got." 
Over the next month I visited lots of places, some out here, around the country, found the best of the best. 
I went down to Washington. I saw these guys, and said, "I did what you asked me. I looked at what's out there. 
I still think you're nuts. But not as nuts as I thought." 
I put a team together, a little over 13 months ago, got up to 20 some-odd people. 
We said, we're going to build a device that does what he wants. 
We have 14 out of the 21 degrees of freedom; you don't need the ones in the last two fingers. 
We put this thing together. 
A couple of weeks ago we took it down to Walter Reed, which is unfortunately more in the news these days. 
We showed it to a bunch of guys. 
One guy who described himself as being lucky, because he lost his left arm, and he's a righty. 
He sat at a table with seven or eight of these other guys. 
Said he was lucky, because he had his good arm, and then he pushed himself back from the table. He had no legs. 
These kids have attitudes that you just can't believe. 
So I'm going to show you now, without the skin on it, a 30-second piece, and then I'm done. 
But understand what you're looking at we made small enough to fit on a 50th percentile female, so that we could put it in any of these people. 
It's going to go inside something that we use in CAT scans and MRIs of whatever is their good arm, to make silicon rubber, then coat it, and paint it in 3D -- exact mirror image of their other limb. 
So, you won't see all the really cool stuff that's in this series elastic set of 14 actuators, each one which has its own capability to sense temperature and pressure. 
It also has a pneumatic cuff that holds it on, so the more they put themselves under load, the more it attaches. 
They take the load off, and it becomes, again, compliant. 
I'm going to show you a guy doing a couple of simple things with this that we demonstrated in Washington. Can we look at this thing? 
Watch the fingers grab. The thumb comes up. Wrist. 
This weighs 6.9 pounds. 
Going to scratch his nose. 
It's got 14 active degrees of freedom. 
Now he's going to pick up a pen with his opposed thumb and index finger. 
Now he's going to put that down, pick up a piece of paper, rotate all the degrees of freedom in his hand and wrist, and read it.

<title>E.O. Wilson: My wish: Build the Encyclopedia of Life</title> 
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: As E.O. Wilson accepts his 2007 TED Prize, he makes a plea on behalf of all creatures that we learn more about our biosphere -- and build a networked encyclopedia of all the world's knowledge about life.</description> 
I have all my life wondered what "mind-boggling" meant. 
After two days here, I declare myself boggled, and enormously impressed, and feel that you are one of the great hopes -- not just for American achievement in science and technology, but for the whole world. 
I've come, however, on a special mission on behalf of my constituency, which are the 10-to-the-18th-power -- that's a million trillion -- insects and other small creatures, and to make a plea for them. 
If we were to wipe out insects alone, just that group alone, on this planet -- which we are trying hard to do -- the rest of life and humanity with it would mostly disappear from the land. 
And within a few months. 
Now, how did I come to this particular position of advocacy? 
As a little boy, and through my teenage years, I became increasingly fascinated by the diversity of life. 
I had a butterfly period, a snake period, a bird period, a fish period, a cave period and finally and definitively, an ant period. 
By my college years, I was a devoted myrmecologist, a specialist on the biology of ants, but my attention and research continued to make journeys across the great variety of life on Earth in general -- including all that it means to us as a species, how little we understand it and how pressing a danger that our activities have created for it. 
Out of that broader study has emerged a concern and an ambition, crystallized in the wish that I'm about to make to you. 
My choice is the culmination of a lifetime commitment that began with growing up on the Gulf Coast of Alabama, on the Florida peninsula. 
As far back as I can remember, I was enchanted by the natural beauty of that region and the almost tropical exuberance of the plants and animals that grow there. 
One day when I was only seven years old and fishing, I pulled a "pinfish," they're called, with sharp dorsal spines, up too hard and fast, and I blinded myself in one eye. 
I later discovered I was also hard of hearing, possibly congenitally, in the upper registers. 
So in planning to be a professional naturalist -- I never considered anything else in my entire life -- I found that I was lousy at bird watching and couldn't track frog calls either. 
So I turned to the teeming small creatures that can be held between the thumb and forefinger: the little things that compose the foundation of our ecosystems, the little things, as I like to say, who run the world. 
In so doing, I reached a frontier of biology so strange, so rich, that it seemed as though it exists on another planet. 
In fact, we live on a mostly unexplored planet. 
The great majority of organisms on Earth remain unknown to science. 
In the last 30 years, thanks to explorations in remote parts of the world and advances in technology, biologists have, for example, added a full one-third of the known frog and other amphibian species, to bring the current total to 5,400, and more continue to pour in. 
Two new kinds of whales have been discovered, along with two new antelopes, dozens of monkey species and a new kind of elephant -- and even a distinct kind of gorilla. 
At the extreme opposite end of the size scale, the class of marine bacteria, the Prochlorococci -- that will be on the final exam -- although discovered only in 1988, are now recognized as likely the most abundant organisms on Earth, and moreover, responsible for a large part of the photosynthesis that occurs in the ocean. 
These bacteria were not uncovered sooner because they are also among the smallest of all Earth's organisms -- so minute that they cannot be seen with conventional optical microscopy. 
Yet life in the sea may depend on these tiny creatures. 
These examples are just the first glimpse of our ignorance of life on this planet. 
Consider the fungi -- including mushrooms, rusts, molds and many disease-causing organisms. 
60,000 species are known to science, but more than 1.5 million have been estimated to exist. 
Consider the nematode roundworm, the most abundant of all animals. 
Four out of five animals on Earth are nematode worms -- if all solid materials except nematode worms were to be eliminated, you could still see the ghostly outline of most of it in nematode worms. 
About 16,000 species of nematode worms have been discovered and diagnosed by scientists; there could be hundreds of thousands of them, even millions, still unknown. 
This vast domain of hidden biodiversity is increased still further by the dark matter of the biological world of bacteria, which within just the last several years still were known from only about 6,000 species of bacteria worldwide. 
But that number of bacteria species can be found in one gram of soil, just a little handful of soil, in the 10 billion bacteria that would be there. 
It's been estimated that a single ton of soil -- fertile soil -- contains approximately four million species of bacteria, all unknown. 
So the question is: what are they all doing? 
The fact is, we don't know. 
We are living on a planet with a lot of activities, with reference to our living environment, done by faith and guess alone. 
Our lives depend upon these creatures. 
To take an example close to home: there are over 500 species of bacteria now known -- friendly bacteria -- living symbiotically in your mouth and throat probably necessary to your health for holding off pathogenic bacteria. 
At this point I think we have a little impressionistic film that was made especially for this occasion. 
And I'd like to show it. 
Assisted in this by Billie Holiday. 
 And that may be just the beginning! 
The viruses, those quasi-organisms among which are the prophages, the gene weavers that promote the continued evolution in the lives of the bacteria, are a virtually unknown frontier of modern biology, a world unto themselves. 
What constitutes a viral species is still unresolved, although they're obviously of enormous importance to us. 
But this much we can say: the variety of genes on the planet in viruses exceeds, or is likely to exceed, that in all of the rest of life combined. 
Nowadays, in addressing microbial biodiversity, scientists are like explorers in a rowboat launched onto the Pacific Ocean. 
But that is changing rapidly with the aid of new genomic technology. 
Already it is possible to sequence the entire genetic code of a bacterium in under four hours. 
Soon we will be in a position to go forth in the field with sequencers on our backs -- to hunt bacteria in tiny crevices of the habitat's surface in the way you go watching for birds with binoculars. 
What will we find as we map the living world, as, finally, we get this underway seriously? 
As we move past the relatively gigantic mammals, birds, frogs and plants to the more elusive insects and other small invertebrates and then beyond to the countless millions of organisms in the invisible living world enveloped and living within humanity? 
Already what were thought to be bacteria for generations have been found to compose, instead, two great domains of microorganisms: true bacteria and one-celled organisms the archaea, which are closer than other bacteria to the eukaryota, the group that we belong to. 
Some serious biologists, and I count myself among them, have begun to wonder that among the enormous and still unknown diversity of microorganisms, one might -- just might -- find aliens among them. 
True aliens, stocks that arrived from outer space. 
They've had billions of years to do it, but especially during the earliest period of biological evolution on this planet. 
We do know that some bacterial species that have earthly origin are capable of almost unimaginable extremes of temperature and other harsh changes in environment, including hard radiation strong enough and maintained long enough to crack the Pyrex vessels around the growing population of bacteria. 
There may be a temptation to treat the biosphere holistically and the species that compose it as a great flux of entities hardly worth distinguishing one from the other. 
But each of these species, even the tiniest Prochlorococci, are masterpieces of evolution. 
Each has persisted for thousands to millions of years. 
Each is exquisitely adapted to the environment in which it lives, interlocked with other species to form ecosystems upon which our own lives depend in ways we have not begun even to imagine. 
We will destroy these ecosystems and the species composing them at the peril of our own existence -- and unfortunately we are destroying them with ingenuity and ceaseless energy. 
My own epiphany as a conservationist came in 1953, while a Harvard graduate student, searching for rare ants found in the mountain forests of Cuba, ants that shine in the sunlight -- metallic green or metallic blue, according to species, and one species, I discovered, metallic gold. 
I found my magical ants, but only after a tough climb into the mountains where the last of the native Cuban forests hung on, and were then -- and still are -- being cut back. 
I realized then that these species and a large part of the other unique, marvelous animals and plants on that island -- and this is true of practically every part of the world -- which took millions of years to evolve, are in the process of disappearing forever. 
And so it is everywhere one looks. 
The human juggernaut is permanently eroding Earth's ancient biosphere by a combination of forces that can be summarized by the acronym "HIPPO," the animal hippo. 
H is for habitat destruction, including climate change forced by greenhouse gases. 
I is for the invasive species like the fire ants, the zebra mussels, broom grasses and pathogenic bacteria and viruses that are flooding every country, and at an exponential rate -- that's the I. 
The P, the first one in "HIPPO," is for pollution. 
The second is for continued population, human population expansion. 
And the final letter is O, for over-harvesting -- driving species into extinction by excessive hunting and fishing. 
The HIPPO juggernaut we have created, if unabated, is destined -- according to the best estimates of ongoing biodiversity research -- to reduce half of Earth's still surviving animal and plant species to extinction or critical endangerment by the end of the century. 
Human-forced climate change alone -- again, if unabated -- could eliminate a quarter of surviving species during the next five decades. 
What will we and all future generations lose if much of the living environment is thus degraded? 
Huge potential sources of scientific information yet to be gathered, much of our environmental stability and new kinds of pharmaceuticals and new products of unimaginable strength and value -- all thrown away. 
The loss will inflict a heavy price in wealth, security and yes, spirituality for all time to come, because previous cataclysms of this kind -- the last one, that ended the age of dinosaurs -- took, normally, five to 10 million years to repair. 
Sadly, our knowledge of biodiversity is so incomplete that we are at risk of losing a great deal of it before it is even discovered. 
For example, even in the United States, the 200,000 species known currently actually has been found to be only partial in coverage; it is mostly unknown to us in basic biology. 
Only about 15 percent of the known species have been studied well enough to evaluate their status. 
Of the 15 percent evaluated, 20 percent are classified as "in peril," that is, in danger of extinction. 
That's in the United States. 
We are, in short, flying blind into our environmental future. 
We urgently need to change this. 
We need to have the biosphere properly explored so that we can understand and competently manage it. 
We need to settle down before we wreck the planet. 
And we need that knowledge. 
This should be a big science project equivalent to the Human Genome Project. 
It should be thought of as a biological moonshot with a timetable. 
So this brings me to my wish for TEDsters, and to anyone else around the world who hears this talk. 
I wish we will work together to help create the key tools that we need to inspire preservation of Earth's biodiversity. 
And let us call it the "Encyclopedia of Life." 
What is the "Encyclopedia of Life?" A concept that has already taken hold and is beginning to spread and be looked at seriously? 
It is an encyclopedia that lives on the Internet and is contributed to by thousands of scientists around the world. 
Amateurs can do it also. 
It has an indefinitely expandable page for each species. 
It makes all key information about life on Earth accessible to anyone, on demand, anywhere in the world. 
I've written about this idea before, and I know there are people in this room who have expended significant effort on it in the past. 
But what excites me is that since I first put forward this particular idea in that form, science has advanced. 
Technology has moved forward. 
Today, the practicalities of making such an encyclopedia, regardless of the magnitude of the information put into it, are within reach. 
Indeed, in the past year, a group of influential scientific institutions have begun mobilizing to realize this dream. 
I wish you would help them. 
Working together, we can make this real. 
The encyclopedia will quickly pay for itself in practical applications. 
It will address transcendent qualities in the human consciousness, and sense of human need. 
It will transform the science of biology in ways of obvious benefit to humanity. 
And most of all, it can inspire a new generation of biologists to continue the quest that started, for me personally, 60 years ago: to search for life, to understand it and finally, above all, to preserve it. 
That is my wish. Thank you.

<title>Bill Clinton: My wish: Rebuilding Rwanda</title> 
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Accepting the 2007 TED Prize, Bill Clinton asks for help in bringing health care to Rwanda -- and the rest of the world.</description> 
I thought in getting up to my TED wish I would try to begin by putting in perspective what I try to do and how it fits with what they try to do. 
We live in a world that everyone knows is interdependent, but insufficient in three major ways. 
It is, first of all, profoundly unequal: half the world's people still living on less than two dollars a day; a billion people with no access to clean water; two and a half billion no access to sanitation; a billion going to bed hungry every night; one in four deaths every year from AIDS, TB, malaria and the variety of infections associated with dirty water -- 
80 percent of them under five years of age. 
Even in wealthy countries it is common now to see inequality growing. 
In the United States, since 2001 we've had five years of economic growth, five years of productivity growth in the workplace, but median wages are stagnant and the percentage of working families dropping below the poverty line is up by four percent. 
The percentage of working families without health care up by four percent. 
So this interdependent world which has been pretty good to most of us -- which is why we're all here in Northern California doing what we do for a living, enjoying this evening -- is profoundly unequal. 
It is also unstable. 
Unstable because of the threats of terror, weapons of mass destruction, the spread of global disease and a sense that we are vulnerable to it in a way that we weren't not so many years ago. 
And perhaps most important of all, it is unsustainable because of climate change, resource depletion and species destruction. 
When I think about the world I would like to leave to my daughter and the grandchildren I hope to have, it is a world that moves away from unequal, unstable, unsustainable interdependence to integrated communities -- locally, nationally and globally -- that share the characteristics of all successful communities: a broadly shared, accessible set of opportunities, 
a shared sense of responsibility for the success of the common enterprise and a genuine sense of belonging. 
All easier said than done. 
When the terrorist incidents occurred in the United Kingdom a couple of years ago, I think even though they didn't claim as many lives as we lost in the United States on 9/11, I think the thing that troubled the British most was that the perpetrators were not invaders, but homegrown citizens whose religious and political identities were more important to them 
than the people they grew up with, went to school with, worked with, shared weekends with, shared meals with. 
In other words, they thought their differences were more important than their common humanity. 
It is the central psychological plague of humankind in the 21st century. 
Into this mix, people like us, who are not in public office, have more power to do good than at any time in history, because more than half the world's people live under governments they voted in and can vote out. 
And even non-democratic governments are more sensitive to public opinion. 
Because primarily of the power of the Internet, people of modest means can band together and amass vast sums of money that can change the world for some public good if they all agree. 
When the tsunami hit South Asia, the United States contributed 1.2 billion dollars. 
30 percent of our households gave. 
Half of them gave over the Internet. 
The median contribution was somewhere around 57 dollars. 
And thirdly, because of the rise of non-governmental organizations. 
They, businesses, other citizens' groups, have enormous power to affect the lives of our fellow human beings. 
When I became president in 1993, there were none of these organizations in Russia. 
There are now a couple of hundred thousand. 
None in India. There are now at least a half a million active. 
None in China. There are now 250,000 registered with the government, probably twice again that many who are not registered for political reasons. 
When I organized my foundation, and I thought about the world as it is and the world that I hope to leave to the next generation, and I tried to be realistic about what I had cared about all my life that I could still have an impact on. 
I wanted to focus on activities that would help to alleviate poverty, fight disease, combat climate change, bridge the religious, racial and other divides that torment the world, but to do it in a way that would either use whatever particular skills we could put together in our group to change the way some public good function was performed so that it would sweep across the world more. 
You saw one reference to that in what we were able to do with AIDS drugs. 
And I want to say that the head of our AIDS effort, and the person who also is primarily active in the wish I'll make tonight, Ira Magaziner, is here with me and I want to thank him for everything he's done. 
He's over there. 
 When I got out of office and was asked to work, first in the Caribbean, to try to help deal with the AIDS crisis, generic drugs were available for about 500 dollars a person a year. 
If you bought them in vast bulks, you could get them at a little under 400 dollars. 
The first country we went to work in, the Bahamas, was paying 3,500 dollars for these drugs. 
The market was so terribly disorganized that they were buying this medicine through two agents who were gigging them sevenfold. 
So the very first week we were working, we got the price down to 500 dollars. 
And all of a sudden, they could save seven times as many lives for the same amount of money. 
Then we went to work with the manufacturers of AIDS medicines, one of whom was cited in the film, and negotiated a whole different change in business strategy, because even at 500 dollars, these drugs were being sold on a high-margin, low-volume, uncertain-payment basis. 
So we worked on improving the productivity of the operations and the supply chain, and went to a low-margin, high-volume, absolutely certain-payment business. 
I joked that the main contribution we made to the battle against AIDS was to get the manufacturers to change from a jewelry store to a grocery store strategy. 
But the price went to 140 dollars from 500. 
And pretty soon, the average price was 192 dollars. 
Now we can get it for about 100 dollars. 
Children's medicine was 600 dollars, because nobody could afford to buy any of it. 
We negotiated it down to 190. 
Then, the French imposed their brilliantly conceived airline tax to create a something called UNITAID, got a bunch of other countries to help. 
That children's medicine is now 60 dollars a person a year. 
The only thing that is keeping us from basically saving the lives of everybody who needs the medicine to stay alive are the absence of systems necessary to diagnose, treat and care for people and deliver this medicine. 
We started a childhood obesity initiative with the Heart Association in America. 
We tried to do the same thing by negotiating industry-right deals with the soft drink and the snack food industry to cut the caloric and other dangerous content of food going to our children in the schools. 
We just reorganized the markets. 
And it occurred to me that in this whole non-governmental world, somebody needs to be thinking about organizing public goods markets. 
And that is now what we're trying to do, and working with this large cities group to fight climate change, to negotiate huge, big, volume deals that will enable cities which generate 75 percent of the world's greenhouse gases, to drastically and quickly reduce greenhouse gas emissions in a way that is good economics. 
And this whole discussion as if it's some sort of economic burden, is a mystery to me. 
I think it's a bird's nest on the ground. 
When Al Gore won his well-deserved Oscar for the "Inconvenient Truth" movie, I was thrilled, but I had urged him to make a second movie quickly. 
For those of you who saw "An Inconvenient Truth," the most important slide in the Gore lecture is the last one, which shows here's where greenhouse gases are going if we don't do anything, here's where they could go. 
And then there are six different categories of things we can do to change the trajectory. 
We need a movie on those six categories. 
And all of you need to have it embedded in your brains and to organize yourselves around it. 
So we're trying to do that. 
So organizing these markets is one thing we try to do. 
Now we have taken on a second thing, and this gets to my wish. 
It has been my experience in working in developing countries that while the headlines may all be -- the pessimistic headlines may say, well, we can't do this, that or the other thing because of corruption -- I think incapacity is a far bigger problem in poor countries than corruption, and feeds corruption. 
We now have the money, given these low prices, to distribute AIDS drugs all over the world to people we cannot presently reach. 
Today these low prices are available in the 25 countries where we work, and in a total of 62 countries, and about 550,000 people are getting the benefits of them. 
But the money is there to reach others. 
The systems are not there to reach the people. 
So what we have been trying to do, working first in Rwanda and then in Malawi and other places -- but I want to talk about Rwanda tonight -- is to develop a model for rural health care in a very poor area that can be used to deal with AIDS, TB, malaria, other infectious diseases, maternal and child health, and a whole range of health issues 
poor people are grappling with in the developing world, that can first be scaled for the whole nation of Rwanda, and then will be a model that could literally be implemented in any other poor country in the world. 
And the test is: one, will it do the job? 
Will it provide high quality care? 
And two, will it do it at a price that will enable the country to sustain a health care system without foreign donors after five to 10 years? 
Because the longer I deal with these problems, the more convinced I am that we have to -- whether it's economics, health, education, whatever -- we have to build systems. 
And the absence of systems that function break the connection which got you all in this seat tonight. 
You think about whatever your life has been, however many obstacles you have faced in your life, at critical junctures you always knew there was a predictable connection between the effort you exerted and the result you achieved. 
In a world with no systems, with chaos, everything becomes a guerilla struggle, and this predictability is not there. 
And it becomes almost impossible to save lives, educate kids, develop economies, whatever. 
The person, in my view, who has done the best job of this in the health care area, of building a system in a very poor area, is Dr. Paul Farmer, who, many of you know, has worked for now 20 years with his group, Partners in Health, primarily in Haiti where he started, but they've also worked in Russia, in Peru 
and other places around the world. 
As poor as Haiti is, in the area where Farmer's clinic is active -- and they serve a catchment area far greater than the medical professionals they have would indicate they could serve -- since 1988, they have not lost one person to tuberculosis, not one. 
And they've achieved a lot of other amazing health results. 
So when we decided to work in Rwanda on trying to dramatically increase the income of the country and fight the AIDS problem, we wanted to build a healthcare network, because it had been totally destroyed during the genocide in 1994, and the per capita income was still under a dollar a day. 
So I rang up, asked Paul Farmer if he would help. 
Because it seemed to me if we could prove there was a model in Haiti and a model in Rwanda that we could then take all over the country, number one, it would be a wonderful thing for a country that has suffered as much as any on Earth in the last 15 years, and number two, we would have something that could then be adapted 
to any other poor country anywhere in the world. 
And so we have set about doing that. 
Now, we started working together 18 months ago. 
And we're working in an area called Southern Kayonza, which is one of the poorest areas in Rwanda, with a group that originally includes about 400,000 people. 
We're essentially implementing what Paul Farmer did in Haiti: he develops and trains paid community health workers who are able to identify health problems, ensure that people who have AIDS or TB are properly diagnosed and take their medicine regularly, who work on bringing about health education, clean water and sanitation, providing nutritional supplements and moving people up the chain of health care 
if they have problems of the severity that require it. 
The procedures that make this work have been perfected, as I said, by Paul Farmer and his team in their work in rural Haiti over the last 20 years. 
Recently we did an evaluation of the first 18 months of our efforts in Rwanda. 
And the results were so good that the Rwandan government has now agreed to adopt the model for the entire country, and has strongly supported and put the full resources of the government behind it. 
I'll tell you a little bit about our team because it's indicative of what we do. 
We have about 500 people around the world working in our AIDS program, some of them for nothing -- just for transportation, room and board. 
And then we have others working in these other related programs. 
Our business plan in Rwanda was put together under the leadership of Diana Noble, who is an unusually gifted woman, but not unusual in the type of people who have been willing to do this kind of work. 
She was the youngest partner at Schroder Ventures in London in her 20s. 
She was CEO of a successful e-venture -- she started and built Reed Elsevier Ventures -- and at 45 she decided she wanted to do something different with her life. 
So she now works full-time on this for very little pay. 
She and her team of former business people have created a business plan that will enable us to scale this health system up for the whole country. 
And it would be worthy of the kind of private equity work she used to do when she was making a lot more money for it. 
When we came to this rural area, 45 percent of the children under the age of five had stunted growth due to malnutrition. 
23 percent of them died before they reached the age of five. 
Mortality at birth was over two-and-a-half percent. 
Over 15 percent of the deaths among adults and children occurred because of intestinal parasites and diarrhea from dirty water and inadequate sanitation -- all entirely preventable and treatable. 
Over 13 percent of the deaths were from respiratory illnesses -- again, all preventable and treatable. 
And not a single soul in this area was being treated for AIDS or tuberculosis. 
Within the first 18 months, the following things happened: we went from zero to about 2,000 people being treated for AIDS. 
That's 80 percent of the people who need treatment in this area. 
Listen to this: less than four-tenths of one percent of those being treated stopped taking their medicine or otherwise defaulted on treatment. 
That's lower than the figure in the United States. 
Less than three-tenths of one percent had to transfer to the more expensive second-line drugs. 
400,000 pregnant women were brought into counseling and will give birth for the first time within an organized healthcare system. 
That's about 43 percent of all the pregnancies. 
About 40 percent of all the people -- I said 400,000. I meant 40,000. 
About 40 percent of all the people who need TB treatment are now getting it -- in just 18 months, up from zero when we started. 
43 percent of the children in need of an infant feeding program to prevent malnutrition and early death are now getting the food supplements they need to stay alive and to grow. 
We've started the first malaria treatment programs they've ever had there. 
Patients admitted to a hospital that was destroyed during the genocide that we have renovated along with four other clinics, complete with solar power generators, good lab technology. 
We now are treating 325 people a month, despite the fact that almost 100 percent of the AIDS patients are now treated at home. 
And the most important thing is because we've implemented Paul Farmer's model, using community health workers, we estimate that this system could be put into place for all of Rwanda for between five and six percent of GDP, and that the government could sustain that without depending on foreign aid after five or six years. 
And for those of you who understand healthcare economics you know that all wealthy countries spend between nine and 11 percent of GDP on health care, except for the United States, we spend 16 -- but that's a story for another day. 
 We're now working with Partners in Health and the Ministry of Health in Rwanda and our Foundation folks to scale this system up. 
We're also beginning to do this in Malawi and Lesotho. 
And we have similar projects in Tanzania, Mozambique, Kenya and Ethiopia with other partners trying to achieve the same thing: to save as many lives as quickly as we can, but to do it in a systematic way that can be implemented nationwide and then with a model that can be implemented in any country in the world. 
We need initial upfront investment to train doctors, nurses, health administration and community health workers throughout the country, to set up the information technology, the solar energy, the water and sanitation, the transportation infrastructure. 
But over a five- to 10-year period, we will take down the need for outside assistance and eventually it will be phased out. 
My wish is that TED assist us in our work and help us to build a high-quality rural health system in a poor country, Rwanda, that can be a model for Africa, and indeed, for any poor country anywhere in the world. 
My belief is that this will help us to build a more integrated world with more partners and fewer terrorists, with more productive citizens and fewer haters, a place we'd all want our kids and our grandchildren to grow up in. 
It has been an honor for me, particularly, to work in Rwanda where we also have a major economic development project in partnership with Sir Tom Hunter, the Scottish philanthropist, where last year we, using the same thing with AIDS drugs, cut the cost of fertilizer and the interest rates on microcredit loans by 30 percent and achieved three- to four-hundred percent increases 
in crop yields with the farmers. 
These people have been through a lot and none of us, most of all me, helped them when they were on the verge of destroying each other. 
We're undoing that now, and they are so over it and so into their future. 
We're doing this in an environmentally responsible way. 
I'm doing my best to convince them not to run the electric grid to the 35 percent of the people that have no access, but to do it with clean energy. To have responsible reforestation projects, the Rwandans, interestingly enough, have been quite good, Mr. Wilson, in preserving their topsoil. 
There's a couple of guys from southern farming families -- the first thing I did when I went out to this place was to get down on my hands and knees and dig in the dirt and see what they'd done with it. 
We have a chance here to prove that a country that almost slaughtered itself out of existence can practice reconciliation, reorganize itself, focus on tomorrow and provide comprehensive, quality health care with minimal outside help. 
I am grateful for this prize, and I will use it to that end. 
We could use some more help to do this, but think of what it would mean if we could have a world-class health system in Rwanda -- in a country with a less-than-one-dollar-a-day-per-capita income, one that could save hundreds of millions of lives over the next decade if applied to every similarly situated country on Earth. 
It's worth a try and I believe it would succeed. 
Thank you and God bless you.

<title>Julia Sweeney: Letting go of God</title> 
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: When two young Mormon missionaries knock on Julia Sweeney's door one day, it touches off a quest to completely rethink her own beliefs, in this excerpt from Sweeney's solo show "Letting Go of God."</description> 
On September 10, the morning of my seventh birthday, I came downstairs to the kitchen, where my mother was washing the dishes and my father was reading the paper or something, and I sort of presented myself to them in the doorway, and they said, "Hey, happy birthday!" And I said, "I'm seven." 
And my father smiled and said, "Well, you know what that means, don't you?" 
And I said, "Yeah, that I'm going to have a party and a cake and get a lot of presents?" And my dad said, "Well, yes. 
But more importantly, being seven means that you've reached the age of reason, and you're now capable of committing any and all sins against God and man." 
 Now, I had heard this phrase, "age of reason," before. 
for our first communion and our first confession, and everybody knew that was really all about the white dress and the white veil. 
And anyway, I hadn't really paid all that much attention to that phrase, "age of reason." 
So, I said, "Yeah, yeah, age of reason. What does that mean again?" 
And my dad said, "Well, we believe, in the Catholic Church, that God knows that little kids don't know the difference between right and wrong, but when you're seven, you're old enough to know better. 
So, you've grown up and reached the age of reason, and now God will start keeping notes on you, and begin your permanent record." 
 And I said, "Oh ... Wait a minute. You mean all that time, up till today, all that time I was so good, God didn't notice it?" 
And my mom said, "Well, I noticed it." 
 And I thought, "How could I not have known this before? 
How could it not have sunk in when they'd been telling me? 
All that being good and no real credit for it. 
And worst of all, how could I not have realized this very important information until the very day that it was basically useless to me?" 
So I said, "Well, Mom and Dad, what about Santa Claus? 
I mean, Santa Claus knows if you're naughty or nice, right?" 
And my dad said, "Yeah, but, honey, I think that's technically just between Thanksgiving and Christmas." 
And my mother said, "Oh, Bob, stop it. Let's just tell her. I mean, she's seven. 
Julie, there is no Santa Claus." 
 Now, this was actually not that upsetting to me. 
My parents had this whole elaborate story about Santa Claus: how they had talked to Santa Claus himself and agreed that instead of Santa delivering our presents over the night of Christmas Eve, like he did for every other family who got to open their surprises first thing Christmas morning, our family would give Santa more time. 
Santa would come to our house while we were at nine o'clock high mass on Christmas morning, but only if all of us kids did not make a fuss. 
Which made me very suspicious. 
It was pretty obvious that it was really our parents giving us the presents. 
I mean, my dad had a very distinctive wrapping style, and my mother's handwriting was so close to Santa's. 
Plus, why would Santa save time by having to loop back to our house after he'd gone to everybody else's? 
There was only one obvious conclusion to reach from this mountain of evidence: our family was too strange and weird for even Santa Claus to come visit, and my poor parents were trying to protect us from the embarrassment, this humiliation of rejection by Santa, who was jolly -- but let's face it, he was also very judgmental. 
So to find out that there was no Santa Claus at all was actually sort of a relief. 
I left the kitchen not really in shock about Santa, but rather, I was just dumbfounded about how I could have missed this whole age of reason thing. 
It was too late for me, but maybe I could help someone else, someone who could use the information. 
They had to fit two criteria: they had to be old enough to be able to understand the whole concept of the age of reason, and not yet seven. 
The answer was clear: my brother Bill. He was six. 
Well, I finally found Bill about a block away from our house at this public school playground. 
It was a Saturday, and he was all by himself, just kicking a ball against the side of a wall. 
I ran up to him and said, "Bill! 
I just realized that the age of reason starts when you turn seven, against God and man." 
And Bill said, "So?" And I said, "So, you're six. 
You have a whole year to do anything you want to and God won't notice it." 
And he said, "So?" And I said, "So? So everything!" 
And I turned to run. I was so angry with him. 
But when I got to the top of the steps, I turned around dramatically and said, "Oh, by the way, Bill -- there is no Santa Claus." 
 Now, I didn't know it at the time, but I really wasn't turning seven on September 10th. 
For my 13th birthday, I planned a slumber party with all of my girlfriends, but a couple of weeks beforehand my mother took me aside and said, "I need to speak to you privately. 
September 10th is not your birthday. It's October 10th." And I said, "What?" 
 "Listen. The cut-off date to start kindergarten was September 15th." 
 "So I told them that your birthday was September 10th, and then I wasn't sure that you weren't just going to go blab it all over the place, so I started to tell you your birthday was September 10th. 
But, Julie, you were so ready to start school, honey. You were so ready." 
I thought about it, and when I was four, I was already the oldest of four children, and my mother even had another child to come, so what I think she -- understandably -- really meant was that she was so ready, she was so ready. 
Then she said, "Don't worry, Julie. Every year on October 10th, when it was your birthday but you didn't realize it, I made sure that you ate a piece of cake that day." 
 Which was comforting, but troubling. 
My mother had been celebrating my birthday with me, without me. 
What was so upsetting about this new piece of information was not that I had to change the date of my slumber party with all of my girlfriends. 
What was most upsetting was that this meant I was not a Virgo. 
I had a huge Virgo poster in my bedroom. 
And I read my horoscope every single day, and it was so totally me. 
 And this meant that I was a Libra? 
So, I took the bus downtown to get the new Libra poster. 
The Virgo poster is a picture of a beautiful woman with long hair, sort of lounging by some water, but the Libra poster is just a huge scale. 
This was around the time that I started filling out physically, and I was filling out a lot more than a lot of the other girls, and frankly, the whole idea that my astrological sign was a scale just seemed ominous and depressing. 
 But I got the new Libra poster, and I started to read my new Libra horoscope, and I was astonished to find that it was also totally me. 
It wasn't until years later, looking back on this whole age-of-reason, change-of-birthday thing, that it dawned on me: I wasn't turning seven when I thought I turned seven. I had a whole other month to do anything I wanted to before God started keeping tabs on me. 
Oh, life can be so cruel. 
One day, two Mormon missionaries came to my door. 
Now, I just live off a main thoroughfare in Los Angeles, and my block is -- well, it's a natural beginning for people who are peddling things door to door. 
Sometimes I get little old ladies from the Seventh Day Adventist Church showing me these cartoon pictures of heaven. 
And sometimes I get teenagers who promise me that they won't join a gang and just start robbing people, if I only buy some magazine subscriptions from them. 
So normally, I just ignore the doorbell, but on this day, I answered. 
And there stood two boys, each about 19, in white, starched short-sleeved shirts, and they had little name tags that identified them as official representatives of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and they said they had a message for me, from God. 
I said, "A message for me? From God?" And they said, "Yes." 
Now, I was raised in the Pacific Northwest, around a lot of Church of Latter-day Saints people and, you know, I've worked with them and even dated them, but I never really knew the doctrine, or what they said to people when they were out on a mission, and I guess I was sort of curious, so I said, "Well, please, come in." And they looked really happy, 
because I don't think this happens to them all that often. 
 And I sat them down, and I got them glasses of water -- Ok, I got it, I got it. I got them glasses of water. 
Don't touch my hair, that's the thing. 
 You can't put a video of myself in front of me and expect me not to fix my hair. 
 So I sat them down and I got them glasses of water, and after niceties, they said, "Do you believe that God loves you with all his heart?" 
And I thought, "Well, of course I believe in God, but you know, I don't like that word 'heart,' because it anthropomorphizes God, and I don't like the word, 'his,' either, because that sexualizes God." 
But I didn't want to argue semantics with these boys, so after a very long, uncomfortable pause, I said, "Yes, yes, I do. I feel very loved." 
And they looked at each other and smiled, like that was the right answer. And then they said, "Do you believe that we're all brothers and sisters on this planet?" 
And I said, "Yes, I do." 
And I was so relieved that it was a question I could answer so quickly. 
And they said, "Well, then we have a story to tell you." 
And they told me this story all about this guy named Lehi, who lived in Jerusalem in 600 BC. 
Now, apparently in Jerusalem in 600 BC, everyone was completely bad and evil. 
Every single one of them: man, woman, child, infant, fetus. 
And God came to Lehi and said to him, "Put your family on a boat and I will lead you out of here." 
And God did lead them. 
He led them to America. 
I said, "America?  From Jerusalem to America by boat in 600 BC?" 
And they said, "Yes." 
 Then they told me how Lehi and his descendants reproduced and reproduced, and over the course of 600 years, there were two great races of them, the Nephites and the Lamanites, and the Nephites were totally good -- each and every one of them -- and the Lamanites were totally bad and evil -- every single one of them just bad to the bone. 
Then, after Jesus died on the cross for our sins, on his way up to heaven, he stopped by America and visited the Nephites. 
 And he told them that if they all remained totally, totally good -- each and every one of them -- they would win the war against the evil Lamanites. 
But apparently somebody blew it, because the Lamanites were able to kill all the Nephites. 
All but one guy, this guy named Mormon, who managed to survive by hiding in the woods. 
And he made sure this whole story was written down in reformed Egyptian hieroglyphics chiseled onto gold plates, which he then buried near Palmyra, New York. 
 Well, I was just on the edge of my seat. 
 I said, "What happened to the Lamanites?" 
And they said, "Well, they became our Native Americans, here in the U.S." 
And I said, "So, you believe the Native Americans are descended from a people who were totally evil?" And they said, "Yes." 
Then they told me how this guy named Joseph Smith found those buried gold plates right in his backyard, and he also found this magic stone back there that he put into his hat and then buried his face into, and this allowed him to translate the gold plates from the reformed Egyptian into English. 
Well, at this point I just wanted to give these two boys some advice about their pitch. 
 I wanted to say --  "Ok, don't start with this story." 
I mean, even the Scientologists know to start with a personality test before they start --  telling people all about Xenu, the evil intergalactic overlord. 
Then, they said, "Do you believe that God speaks to us through his righteous prophets?" And I said, "No, I don't," because I was sort of upset about this Lamanite story and this crazy gold plate story, but the truth was, I hadn't really thought this through, so I backpedaled a little and I said, "Well, what exactly do you mean by 'righteous'? 
And what do you mean by prophets? Like, could the prophets be women?" 
And they said, "No." And I said, "Why?" 
And they said, "Well, it's because God gave women a gift that is so spectacular, it is so wonderful, that the only gift he had left over to give men was the gift of prophecy." 
What is this wonderful gift God gave women, I wondered? 
Maybe their greater ability to cooperate and adapt? 
Women's longer lifespan? The fact that women tend to be much less violent than men? 
But no -- it wasn't any of these gifts. 
They said, "Well, it's her ability to bear children." 
I said, "Oh, come on. I mean, even if women tried to have a baby every single year from the time they were 15 to the time they were 45, assuming they didn't die from exhaustion, it still seems like some women would have some time left over to hear the word of God." And they said, "No." 
 Well, then they didn't look so fresh-faced and cute to me any more, but they had more to say. 
They said, "Well, we also believe that if you're a Mormon, and if you're in good standing with the church, when you die, you get to go to heaven and be with your family for all eternity." 
And I said, "Oh, dear. 
 That wouldn't be such a good incentive for me." 
 And they said, "Oh. 
Hey! Well, we also believe that when you go to heaven, you get your body restored to you in its best original state. 
Like, if you'd lost a leg, well, you get it back. 
Or, if you'd gone blind, you could see." 
I said, "Oh. Now, I don't have a uterus, because I had cancer a few years ago. So does this mean that if I went to heaven, I would get my old uterus back?" And they said, "Sure." 
And I said, "I don't want it back. I'm happy without it." Gosh. 
What if you had a nose job and you liked it? 
 Would God force you to get your old nose back? 
Then they gave me this Book of Mormon, told me to read this chapter and that chapter, and said they'd come back and check in on me, and I think I said something like, "Please don't hurry," or maybe just, "Please don't," and they were gone. 
Ok, so I initially felt really superior to these boys, and smug in my more conventional faith. 
But then the more I thought about it, the more I had to be honest with myself. 
If someone came to my door and I was hearing Catholic theology and dogma for the very first time, and they said, "We believe that God impregnated a very young girl without the use of intercourse, and the fact that she was a virgin is maniacally important to us." 
 "And she had a baby, and that's the son of God," I mean, I would think that's equally ridiculous. 
I'm just so used to that story. 
 So, I couldn't let myself feel condescending towards these boys. 
But the question they asked me when they first arrived really stuck in my head: Did I believe that God loved me with all his heart? 
Because I wasn't exactly sure how I felt about that question. 
Now, if they had asked me, "Do you feel that God loves you with all his heart?" 
Well, that would have been much different, I think I would have instantly answered, "Yes, yes, I feel it all the time. I feel God's love when I'm hurt and confused, and I feel consoled and cared for. 
I take shelter in God's love when I don't understand why tragedy hits, and I feel God's love when I look with gratitude at all the beauty I see." 
But since they asked me that question with the word "believe" in it, somehow it was all different, because I wasn't exactly sure if I believed what I so clearly felt.
