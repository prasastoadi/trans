<seg id="1"> Hello, TEDWomen, what's up.    </seg>
<seg id="2">   Not good enough.    </seg>
<seg id="3"> Hello, TEDWomen, what is up?    </seg>
<seg id="4"> (Loud cheering)  My name is Maysoon Zayid,  and I am not drunk,  but the doctor who delivered me was.    </seg>
<seg id="5"> He cut my mom six different times  in six different directions,  suffocating poor little me in the process.    </seg>
<seg id="6"> As a result, I have cerebral palsy,  which means I shake all the time.    </seg>
<seg id="7"> Look.    </seg>
<seg id="8"> It's exhausting.    </seg>
<seg id="9"> I'm like Shakira, Shakira meets Muhammad Ali.    </seg>
<seg id="10">   CP is not genetic.    </seg>
<seg id="11"> It's not a birth defect. You can't catch it.    </seg>
<seg id="12"> No one put a curse on my mother's uterus,  and I didn't get it because my parents are first cousins,  which they are.    </seg>
<seg id="13">   It only happens from accidents,  like what happened to me on my birth day.    </seg>
<seg id="14"> Now, I must warn you, I'm not inspirational.    </seg>
<seg id="15"> And I don't want anyone in this room to feel bad for me,  because at some point in your life,  you have dreamt of being disabled.    </seg>
<seg id="16"> Come on a journey with me.    </seg>
<seg id="17"> It's Christmas Eve, you're at the mall,  you're driving around in circles looking for parking,  and what do you see?    </seg>
<seg id="18"> Sixteen empty handicapped spaces.   And you're like, "God, can't I just be a little disabled?"    </seg>
<seg id="19">   Also, I've got to tell you,  I've got 99 problems, and palsy is just one.    </seg>
<seg id="20"> If there was an Oppression Olympics,  I would win the gold medal.    </seg>
<seg id="21"> I'm Palestinian, Muslim, I'm female, I'm disabled,  and I live in New Jersey.    </seg>
<seg id="22">    If you don't feel better about yourself, maybe you should.    </seg>
<seg id="23"> Cliffside Park, New Jersey is my hometown.    </seg>
<seg id="24"> I have always loved the fact  that my hood and my affliction share the same initials.    </seg>
<seg id="25"> I also love the fact  that if I wanted to walk from my house to New York City, I could.    </seg>
<seg id="26"> A lot of people with CP don't walk,  but my parents didn't believe in "can't."    </seg>
<seg id="27"> My father's mantra was,  "You can do it, yes you can can."    </seg>
<seg id="28">   So, if my three older sisters were mopping,  I was mopping.    </seg>
<seg id="29"> If my three older sisters went to public school,  my parents would sue the school system  and guarantee that I went too,  and if we didn't all get A's,  we all got my mother's slipper.    </seg>
<seg id="30">   My father taught me how to walk when I was five years old  by placing my heels on his feet  and just walking.    </seg>
<seg id="31"> Another tactic that he used  is he would dangle a dollar bill in front of me and have me chase it.    </seg>
<seg id="32">   My inner stripper was very strong.    </seg>
<seg id="33">   Yeah. No, by the first day of kindergarten,  I was walking like a champ  who had been punched one too many times.    </seg>
<seg id="34"> Growing up, there were only six Arabs in my town,  and they were all my family.    </seg>
<seg id="35"> Now there are 20 Arabs in town,  and they are still all my family.   I don't think anyone even noticed we weren't Italian.    </seg>
<seg id="36">    This was before 9/11 and before politicians thought it was appropriate  to use "I hate Muslims" as a campaign slogan.    </seg>
<seg id="37"> The people that I grew up with had no problem with my faith.    </seg>
<seg id="38"> They did, however, seem very concerned  that I would starve to death during Ramadan.    </seg>
<seg id="39"> I would explain to them that I have enough fat  to live off of for three whole months,  so fasting from sunrise to sunset is a piece of cake.    </seg>
<seg id="40"> I have tap-danced on Broadway.    </seg>
<seg id="41"> Yeah, on Broadway. It's crazy.   My parents couldn't afford physical therapy,  so they sent me to dancing school.    </seg>
<seg id="42"> I learned how to dance in heels,  which means I can walk in heels.    </seg>
<seg id="43"> And I'm from Jersey,  and we are really concerned with being chic,  so if my friends wore heels, so did I.    </seg>
<seg id="44"> And when my friends went and spent their summer vacations  on the Jersey Shore, I did not.    </seg>
<seg id="45"> I spent my summers in a war zone,  because my parents were afraid  that if we didn't go back to Palestine every single summer,  we'd grow up to be Madonna.    </seg>
<seg id="46">   Summer vacations often consisted of my father trying to heal me,  so I drank deer's milk,  I had hot cups on my back,  I was dunked in the Dead Sea,  and I remember the water burning my eyes  and thinking, "It's working! It's working!"    </seg>
<seg id="47">   But one miracle cure we did find was yoga.    </seg>
<seg id="48"> I have to tell you, it's very boring,  but before I did yoga,  I was a stand-up comedian who can't stand up.    </seg>
<seg id="49"> And now I can stand on my head.    </seg>
<seg id="50"> My parents reinforced this notion  that I could do anything,  that no dream was impossible,  and my dream was to be  on the daytime soap opera "General Hospital."    </seg>
<seg id="51"> I went to college during affirmative action  and got a sweet scholarship to ASU,  Arizona State University,  because I fit every single quota.    </seg>
<seg id="52"> I was like the pet lemur of the theater department.    </seg>
<seg id="53"> Everybody loved me.    </seg>
<seg id="54"> I did all the less-than-intelligent kids' homework,  I got A's in all of my classes,  A's in all of their classes.    </seg>
<seg id="55">   Every time I did a scene from "The Glass Menagerie,"  my professors would weep.    </seg>
<seg id="56"> But I never got cast.    </seg>
<seg id="57"> Finally, my senior year,  ASU decided to do a show called "They Dance Real Slow in Jackson."    </seg>
<seg id="58"> It's a play about a girl with CP.    </seg>
<seg id="59"> I was a girl with CP.    </seg>
<seg id="60"> So I start shouting from the rooftops,  "I'm finally going to get a part!    </seg>
<seg id="61"> I have cerebral palsy!    </seg>
<seg id="62"> Free at last! Free at last!    </seg>
<seg id="63"> Thank God almighty, I'm free at last!"    </seg>
<seg id="64"> I didn't get the part.   Sherry Brown got the part.    </seg>
<seg id="65"> I went racing to the head of the theater department  crying hysterically, like someone shot my cat,  to ask her why,  and she said it was because they didn't think I could do the stunts.    </seg>
<seg id="66"> I said, "Excuse me, if I can't do the stunts,  neither can the character."    </seg>
<seg id="67">    This was a part that I was literally born to play  they gave it to a non-palsy actress.    </seg>
<seg id="68"> College was imitating life.    </seg>
<seg id="69"> Hollywood has a sordid history  of casting able-bodied actors to play disabled onscreen.    </seg>
<seg id="70"> Upon graduating, I moved back home,  and my first acting gig was as an extra on a daytime soap opera.    </seg>
<seg id="71"> My dream was coming true.    </seg>
<seg id="72"> And I knew that I would be promoted  from "Diner Diner" to "Wacky Best Friend" in no time.    </seg>
<seg id="73"> But instead, I remained a glorified piece of furniture  that you could only recognize from the back of my head,  and it became clear to me  that casting directors  didn't hire fluffy, ethnic, disabled actors.    </seg>
<seg id="74"> They only hired perfect people.    </seg>
<seg id="75"> But there were exceptions to the rule.    </seg>
<seg id="76"> I grew up watching Whoopi Goldberg,  Roseanne Barr, Ellen,  and all of these women had one thing in common:  they were comedians.    </seg>
<seg id="77"> So I became a comic.    </seg>
<seg id="78">    My first gig was driving famous comics  from New York City to shows in New Jersey,  and I'll never forget the face of the first comic I ever drove  when he realized that he was speeding down the New Jersey Turnpike  with a chick with CP driving him.    </seg>
<seg id="79"> I've performed in clubs all over America,  and I've also performed in Arabic in the Middle East,  uncensored and uncovered.    </seg>
<seg id="80">   Some people say I'm the first stand-up comic in the Arab world.    </seg>
<seg id="81"> I never like to claim first,  but I do know that they never heard  that nasty little rumor that women aren't funny,  and they find us hysterical.    </seg>
<seg id="82"> In 2003, my brother from another mother and father  Dean Obeidallah and I started  the New York Arab-American Comedy Festival,  now in its 10th year.    </seg>
<seg id="83"> Our goal was to change the negative image of Arab-Americans in media,  while also reminding casting directors  that South Asian and Arab are not synonymous.    </seg>
<seg id="84">   Mainstreaming Arabs was much, much easier  than conquering the challenge against the stigma against disability.    </seg>
<seg id="85"> My big break came in 2010.    </seg>
<seg id="86"> I was invited to be a guest on the cable news show  "Countdown with Keith Olbermann."    </seg>
<seg id="87"> I walked in looking like I was going to the prom,  and they shuffle me into a studio  and seat me on a spinning, rolling chair.    </seg>
<seg id="88"> So I looked at the stage manager  and I'm like, "Excuse me, can I have another chair?"    </seg>
<seg id="89"> And she looked at me and she went,  "Five, four, three, two ..."    </seg>
<seg id="90"> And we were live, right?    </seg>
<seg id="91"> So I had to grip onto the anchor's desk  so that I wouldn't roll off the screen during the segment,  and when the interview was over, I was livid.    </seg>
<seg id="92"> I had finally gotten my chance and I blew it,  and I knew I would never get invited back.    </seg>
<seg id="93"> But not only did Mr. Olbermann invite me back,  he made me a full-time contributor,  and he taped down my chair.    </seg>
<seg id="94">    One fun fact I learned while on the air with Keith Olbermann  was that humans on the Internet are scumbags.    </seg>
<seg id="95"> People say children are cruel,  but I was never made fun of as a child or an adult.    </seg>
<seg id="96"> Suddenly, my disability on the world wide web is fair game.    </seg>
<seg id="97"> I would look at clips online and see comments like,  "Yo, why's she tweakin'?"    </seg>
<seg id="98"> "Yo, is she retarded?"    </seg>
<seg id="99"> And my favorite, "Poor Gumby-mouth terrorist.    </seg>
<seg id="100"> What does she suffer from?    </seg>
<seg id="101"> We should really pray for her."    </seg>
<seg id="102"> One commenter even suggested that I add my disability to my credits:  screenwriter, comedian, palsy.    </seg>
<seg id="103"> Disability is as visual as race.    </seg>
<seg id="104"> If a wheelchair user can't play Beyoncé,  then Beyoncé can't play a wheelchair user.    </seg>
<seg id="105"> The disabled are the largest —  Yeah, clap for that, man. Come on.    </seg>
<seg id="106">   People with disabilities are the largest minority in the world,  and we are the most underrepresented in entertainment.    </seg>
<seg id="107"> The doctors said that I wouldn't walk,  but I am here in front of you.    </seg>
<seg id="108"> However, if I grew up with social media,  I don't think I would be.    </seg>
<seg id="109"> I hope that together,  we can create more positive images  of disability in the media and in everyday life.    </seg>
<seg id="110"> Perhaps if there were more positive images,  it would foster less hate on the Internet.    </seg>
<seg id="111"> Or maybe not.    </seg>
<seg id="112"> Maybe it still takes a village to teach our children well.    </seg>
<seg id="113"> My crooked journey has taken me to some very spectacular places.    </seg>
<seg id="114"> I got to walk the red carpet  flanked by soap diva Susan Lucci  and the iconic Loreen Arbus.    </seg>
<seg id="115"> I got to act in a movie with Adam Sandler  and work with my idol, the amazing Dave Matthews.    </seg>
<seg id="116"> I toured the world as a headliner on Arabs Gone Wild.    </seg>
<seg id="117"> I was a delegate representing the great state of New Jersey  at the 2008 DNC.    </seg>
<seg id="118"> And I founded Maysoon's Kids,  a charity that hopes to give Palestinian refugee children  a sliver of the chance my parents gave me.    </seg>
<seg id="119"> But the one moment that stands out the most  was when I got -- before this moment --     But the one moment that stands out the most  was when I got to perform  for the man who floats like a butterfly  and stings like a bee,  has Parkinson's and shakes just like me,  Muhammad Ali.    </seg>
<seg id="120">   (Applause ends)  It was the only time that my father ever saw me perform live,  and I dedicate this talk to his memory.    </seg>
<seg id="121">  Allah yerhamak yaba.    </seg>
<seg id="122">  My name is Maysoon Zayid,  and if I can can, you can can.    </seg>

<title>Mohamed Ali: The link between unemployment and terrorism</title> 
<reviewer></reviewer> 
<translator></translator> 
<seg id="1"> I would like to talk to you about a story  about a small town kid.    </seg>
<seg id="2"> I don't know his name, but I do know his story.    </seg>
<seg id="3"> He lives in a small village in southern Somalia.    </seg>
<seg id="4"> His village is near Mogadishu.    </seg>
<seg id="5"> Drought drives the small village into poverty  and to the brink of starvation.    </seg>
<seg id="6"> With nothing left for him there,  he leaves for the big city,  in this case, Mogadishu, the capital of Somalia.    </seg>
<seg id="7"> When he arrives, there are no opportunities,  no jobs, no way forward.    </seg>
<seg id="8"> He ends up living in a tent city  on the outskirts of Mogadishu.    </seg>
<seg id="9"> Maybe a year passes, nothing.    </seg>
<seg id="10"> One day, he's approached by a gentleman  who offers to take him to lunch,  then to dinner, to breakfast.    </seg>
<seg id="11"> He meets this dynamic group of people,  and they give him a break.    </seg>
<seg id="12"> He's given a bit of money  to buy himself some new clothes,  money to send back home to his family.    </seg>
<seg id="13"> He is introduced to this young woman.    </seg>
<seg id="14"> He eventually gets married.    </seg>
<seg id="15"> He starts this new life.    </seg>
<seg id="16"> He has a purpose in life.    </seg>
<seg id="17"> One beautiful day in Mogadishu,  under an azure blue sky,  a car bomb goes off.    </seg>
<seg id="18"> That small town kid with the big city dreams  was the suicide bomber,  and that dynamic group of people  were al Shabaab, a terrorist organization  linked to al Qaeda.    </seg>
<seg id="19"> So how does the story of a small town kid  just trying to make it big in the city  end up with him blowing himself up?    </seg>
<seg id="20"> He was waiting.    </seg>
<seg id="21"> He was waiting for an opportunity,  waiting to begin his future,  waiting for a way forward,  and this was the first thing that came along.    </seg>
<seg id="22"> This was the first thing that pulled him out  of what we call waithood.    </seg>
<seg id="23"> And his story repeats itself  in urban centers around the world.    </seg>
<seg id="24"> It is the story of the disenfranchised,  unemployed urban youth  who sparks riots in Johannesburg,  sparks riots in London,  who reaches out for something other than waithood.    </seg>
<seg id="25"> For young people, the promise of the city,  the big city dream is that of opportunity,  of jobs, of wealth,  but young people are not sharing in the prosperity of their cities.    </seg>
<seg id="26"> Often it's youth who suffer from the highest unemployment rates.    </seg>
<seg id="27"> By 2030, three out of five people living in cities  will be under the age of 18.    </seg>
<seg id="28"> If we do not include young people  in the growth of our cities,  if we do not provide them opportunities,  the story of waithood,  the gateway to terrorism, to violence, to gangs,  will be the story of cities 2.0.    </seg>
<seg id="29"> And in my city of birth, Mogadishu,  70 percent of young people suffer from unemployment.    </seg>
<seg id="30"> 70 percent don't work,  don't go to school.    </seg>
<seg id="31"> They pretty much do nothing.    </seg>
<seg id="32"> I went back to Mogadishu last month,  and I went to visit Madina Hospital,  the hospital I was born in.    </seg>
<seg id="33"> I remember standing in front of that  bullet-ridden hospital thinking,  what if I had never left?    </seg>
<seg id="34"> What if I had been forced  into that same state of waithood?    </seg>
<seg id="35"> Would I have become a terrorist?    </seg>
<seg id="36"> I'm not really sure about the answer.    </seg>
<seg id="37"> My reason for being in Mogadishu that month  was actually to host  a youth leadership and entrepreneurship summit.    </seg>
<seg id="38"> I brought together about 90 young Somali leaders.    </seg>
<seg id="39"> We sat down and brainstormed on solutions  to the biggest challenges facing their city.    </seg>
<seg id="40"> One of the young men in the room was Aden.    </seg>
<seg id="41"> He went to university in Mogadishu, graduated.    </seg>
<seg id="42"> There were no jobs, no opportunities.    </seg>
<seg id="43"> I remember him telling me,  because he was a college graduate,  that he was the perfect target for al Shabaab  and other terrorist organizations, to be recruited.    </seg>
<seg id="44"> They sought people like him out.    </seg>
<seg id="45"> But his story takes a different route.    </seg>
<seg id="46"> In Mogadishu, the biggest barrier  to getting from point A to point B are the roads.    </seg>
<seg id="47"> Twenty-three years of civil war  have completely destroyed the road system,  and a motorbike can be the easiest way  to get around.    </seg>
<seg id="48"> Aden saw an opportunity and seized it.    </seg>
<seg id="49"> He started a motorbike company.    </seg>
<seg id="50"> He began renting out motorbikes  to local residents who couldn't normally afford them.    </seg>
<seg id="51"> He bought 10 bikes, with the help  of family and friends,  and his dream is to eventually expand  to several hundred within the next three years.    </seg>
<seg id="52"> How is this story different?    </seg>
<seg id="53"> What makes his story different?    </seg>
<seg id="54"> I believe it is his ability to identify  and seize a new opportunity.    </seg>
<seg id="55"> It's entrepreneurship,  and I believe entrepreneurship can be  the most powerful tool against waithood.    </seg>
<seg id="56"> It empowers young people  to be the creators of the very economic opportunities  they are so desperately seeking.    </seg>
<seg id="57"> And you can train young people to be entrepreneurs.    </seg>
<seg id="58"> I want to talk to you about a young man  who attended one of my meetings,  Mohamed Mohamoud, a florist.    </seg>
<seg id="59"> He was helping me train some of the young people  at the summit in entrepreneurship  and how to be innovative  and how to create a culture of entrepreneurship.    </seg>
<seg id="60"> He's actually the first florist Mogadishu has seen  in over 22 years,  and until recently, until Mohamed came along,  if you wanted flowers at your wedding,  you used plastic bouquets  shipped from abroad.    </seg>
<seg id="61"> If you asked someone,  "When was the last time you saw fresh flowers?"    </seg>
<seg id="62"> for many who grew up under civil war,  the answer would be, "Never."    </seg>
<seg id="63"> So Mohamed saw an opportunity.    </seg>
<seg id="64"> He started a landscaping and design floral company.    </seg>
<seg id="65"> He created a farm right outside of Mogadishu,  and started growing tulips and lilies,  which he said could survive  the harsh Mogadishu climate.    </seg>
<seg id="66"> And he began delivering flowers to weddings,  creating gardens at homes  and businesses around the city,  and he's now working on creating  Mogadishu's first public park in 22 years.    </seg>
<seg id="67"> There's no public park in Mogadishu.    </seg>
<seg id="68"> He wants to create a space where families,  young people, can come together,  and, as he says, smell the proverbial roses.    </seg>
<seg id="69"> And he doesn't grow roses because  they use too much water, by the way.    </seg>
<seg id="70"> So the first step is to inspire young people,  and in that room, Mohamed's presence  had a really profound impact on the youth in that room.    </seg>
<seg id="71"> They had never really thought about starting up a business.    </seg>
<seg id="72"> They've thought about working for an NGO,  working for the government,  but his story, his innovation,  really had a strong impact on them.    </seg>
<seg id="73"> He forced them to look at their city  as a place of opportunity.    </seg>
<seg id="74"> He empowered them to believe that they could be entrepreneurs,  that they could be change makers.    </seg>
<seg id="75"> By the end of the day, they were coming up  with innovative solutions  to some of the biggest challenges facing their city.    </seg>
<seg id="76"> They came up with entrepreneurial solutions  to local problems.    </seg>
<seg id="77"> So inspiring young people  and creating a culture of entrepreneurship  is a really great step,  but young people need capital  to make their ideas a reality.    </seg>
<seg id="78"> They need expertise and mentorship  to guide them in developing and launching their businesses.    </seg>
<seg id="79"> Connect young people with the resources they need,  provide them the support they need to go from ideation to creation,  and you will create catalysts for urban growth.    </seg>
<seg id="80"> For me, entrepreneurship is more than just  starting up a business.    </seg>
<seg id="81"> It's about creating a social impact.    </seg>
<seg id="82"> Mohamed is not simply selling flowers.    </seg>
<seg id="83"> I believe he is selling hope.    </seg>
<seg id="84"> His Peace Park, and that's what he calls it,  when it's created, will actually transform  the way people see their city.    </seg>
<seg id="85"> Aden hired street kids to help rent out  and maintain those bikes for him.    </seg>
<seg id="86"> He gave them the opportunity to escape  the paralysis of waithood.    </seg>
<seg id="87"> These young entrepreneurs are having  a tremendous impact in their cities.    </seg>
<seg id="88"> So my suggestion is,  turn youth into entrepreneurs,  incubate and nurture their inherent innovation,  and you will have more stories of flowers and Peace Parks  than of car bombs and waithood.    </seg>
<seg id="89"> Thank you.    </seg>

<seg id="1"> I was about 10 years old  on a camping trip with my dad  in the Adirondack Mountains, a wilderness area  in the northern part of New York State.    </seg>
<seg id="2"> It was a beautiful day.    </seg>
<seg id="3"> The forest was sparkling.    </seg>
<seg id="4"> The sun made the leaves glow like stained glass,  and if it weren't for the path we were following,  we could almost pretend we were  the first human beings to ever walk that land.    </seg>
<seg id="5"> We got to our campsite.    </seg>
<seg id="6"> It was a lean-to on a bluff  looking over a crystal, beautiful lake,  when I discovered a horror.    </seg>
<seg id="7"> Behind the lean-to was a dump,  maybe 40 feet square  with rotting apple cores  and balled-up aluminum foil,  and a dead sneaker.    </seg>
<seg id="8"> And I was astonished,  I was very angry, and I was deeply confused.    </seg>
<seg id="9"> The campers who were too lazy  to take out what they had brought in,  who did they think would clean up after them?    </seg>
<seg id="10"> That question stayed with me,  and it simplified a little.    </seg>
<seg id="11"> Who cleans up after us?    </seg>
<seg id="12"> However you configure  or wherever you place the us,  who cleans up after us in Istanbul?    </seg>
<seg id="13"> Who cleans up after us in Rio  or in Paris or in London?    </seg>
<seg id="14"> Here in New York,  the Department of Sanitation cleans up after us,  to the tune of 11,000 tons of garbage  and 2,000 tons of recyclables every day.    </seg>
<seg id="15"> I wanted to get to know them as individuals.    </seg>
<seg id="16"> I wanted to understand who takes the job.    </seg>
<seg id="17"> What's it like to wear the uniform  and bear that burden?    </seg>
<seg id="18"> So I started a research project with them.    </seg>
<seg id="19"> I rode in the trucks and walked the routes  and interviewed people in offices and facilities  all over the city,  and I learned a lot,  but I was still an outsider.    </seg>
<seg id="20"> I needed to go deeper.    </seg>
<seg id="21"> So I took the job as a sanitation worker.    </seg>
<seg id="22"> I didn't just ride in the trucks now. I drove the trucks.    </seg>
<seg id="23"> And I operated the mechanical brooms and I plowed the snow.    </seg>
<seg id="24"> It was a remarkable privilege  and an amazing education.    </seg>
<seg id="25"> Everyone asks about the smell.    </seg>
<seg id="26"> It's there, but it's not as prevalent as you think,  and on days when it is really bad,  you get used to it rather quickly.    </seg>
<seg id="27"> The weight takes a long time to get used to.    </seg>
<seg id="28"> I knew people who were several years on the job  whose bodies were still adjusting to the burden  of bearing on your body  tons of trash every week.    </seg>
<seg id="29"> Then there's the danger.    </seg>
<seg id="30"> According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics,  sanitation work is one of the 10 most dangerous  occupations in the country,  and I learned why.    </seg>
<seg id="31"> You're in and out of traffic all day,  and it's zooming around you.    </seg>
<seg id="32"> It just wants to get past you, so it's often  the motorist is not paying attention.    </seg>
<seg id="33"> That's really bad for the worker.    </seg>
<seg id="34"> And then the garbage itself is full of hazards  that often fly back out of the truck  and do terrible harm.    </seg>
<seg id="35"> I also learned about the relentlessness of trash.    </seg>
<seg id="36"> When you step off the curb  and you see a city from behind a truck,  you come to understand that trash  is like a force of nature unto itself.    </seg>
<seg id="37"> It never stops coming.    </seg>
<seg id="38"> It's also like a form of respiration or circulation.    </seg>
<seg id="39"> It must always be in motion.    </seg>
<seg id="40"> And then there's the stigma.    </seg>
<seg id="41"> You put on the uniform, and you become invisible  until someone is upset with you for whatever reason  like you've blocked traffic with your truck,  or you're taking a break too close to their home,  or you're drinking coffee in their diner,  and they will come and scorn you,  and tell you that they don't want you anywhere near them.    </seg>
<seg id="42"> I find the stigma especially ironic,  because I strongly believe that sanitation workers  are the most important labor force  on the streets of the city, for three reasons.    </seg>
<seg id="43"> They are the first guardians of public health.    </seg>
<seg id="44"> If they're not taking away trash  efficiently and effectively every day,  it starts to spill out of its containments,  and the dangers inherent to it threaten us  in very real ways.    </seg>
<seg id="45"> Diseases we've had in check for decades and centuries  burst forth again and start to harm us.    </seg>
<seg id="46"> The economy needs them.    </seg>
<seg id="47"> If we can't throw out the old stuff,  we have no room for the new stuff,  so then the engines of the economy  start to sputter when consumption is compromised.    </seg>
<seg id="48"> I'm not advocating capitalism, I'm just pointing out their relationship.    </seg>
<seg id="49"> And then there's what I call  our average, necessary quotidian velocity.    </seg>
<seg id="50"> By that I simply mean  how fast we're used to moving  in the contemporary day and age.    </seg>
<seg id="51"> We usually don't care for, repair, clean, carry around  our coffee cup, our shopping bag,  our bottle of water.    </seg>
<seg id="52"> We use them, we throw them out, we forget about them,  because we know there's a workforce  on the other side that's going to take it all away.    </seg>
<seg id="53"> So I want to suggest today a couple of ways  to think about sanitation that will perhaps help  ameliorate the stigma  and bring them into this conversation  of how to craft a city that is sustainable and humane.    </seg>
<seg id="54"> Their work, I think, is kind of liturgical.    </seg>
<seg id="55"> They're on the streets every day, rhythmically.    </seg>
<seg id="56"> They wear a uniform in many cities.    </seg>
<seg id="57"> You know when to expect them.    </seg>
<seg id="58"> And their work lets us do our work.    </seg>
<seg id="59"> They are almost a form of reassurance.    </seg>
<seg id="60"> The flow that they maintain  keeps us safe from ourselves,  from our own dross, our cast-offs,  and that flow must be maintained always  no matter what.    </seg>
<seg id="61"> On the day after September 11 in 2001,  I heard the growl of a sanitation truck on the street,  and I grabbed my infant son and I ran downstairs  and there was a man doing his paper recycling route  like he did every Wednesday.    </seg>
<seg id="62"> And I tried to thank him for doing his work  on that day of all days,  but I started to cry.    </seg>
<seg id="63"> And he looked at me,  and he just nodded, and he said,  "We're going to be okay.    </seg>
<seg id="64"> We're going to be okay."    </seg>
<seg id="65"> It was a little while later that I started  my research with sanitation,  and I met that man again.    </seg>
<seg id="66"> His name is Paulie, and we worked together many times,  and we became good friends.    </seg>
<seg id="67"> I want to believe that Paulie was right.    </seg>
<seg id="68"> We are going to be okay.    </seg>
<seg id="69"> But in our effort to reconfigure  how we as a species exist on this planet,  we must include and take account of  all the costs, including the very real human cost  of the labor.    </seg>
<seg id="70"> And we also would be well informed  to reach out to the people who do that work  and get their expertise  on how do we think about,  how do we create systems around sustainability  that perhaps take us from curbside recycling,  which is a remarkable success across 40 years,  across the United States and countries around the world,    </seg>
<seg id="71"> and lift us up to a broader horizon  where we're looking at other forms of waste  that could be lessened  from manufacturing and industrial sources.    </seg>
<seg id="72"> Municipal waste, what we think of when we talk about garbage,  accounts for three percent of the nation's waste stream.    </seg>
<seg id="73"> It's a remarkable statistic.    </seg>
<seg id="74"> So in the flow of your days,  in the flow of your lives,  next time you see someone whose job is  to clean up after you,  take a moment to acknowledge them.    </seg>
<seg id="75"> Take a moment to say thank you.    </seg>

<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: When TED Fellow Xavier Vilalta was commissioned to create a multistory shopping mall in Addis Ababa, he panicked. Other centers represented everything he hated about contemporary architecture: wasteful, glass towers requiring tons of energy whose design had absolutely nothing to do with Africa. In this charming talk, Vilalta shows how he champions an alternative approach: to harness nature, reference design tradition and create beautiful, modern, iconic buildings fit for a community.</description>

<title>Xavier Vilalta: Architecture at home in its community</title> 
<reviewer></reviewer> 
<translator></translator> 
<seg id="1"> My work focuses on the connection of  both thinking about our community life  being part of the environment  where architecture grows from the natural  local conditions and traditions.    </seg>
<seg id="2"> Today I brought two recent projects  as an example of this.    </seg>
<seg id="3"> Both projects are in emerging countries,  one in Ethiopia and another one in Tunisia.    </seg>
<seg id="4"> And also they have in common  that the different analyses from different perspectives  becomes an essential part of the final piece of architecture.    </seg>
<seg id="5"> The first example started with an invitation  to design a multistory shopping mall  in Ethiopia's capital city Addis Ababa.    </seg>
<seg id="6"> And this is the type of building  we were shown as an example, to my team and myself,  of what we had to design.    </seg>
<seg id="7"> At first, the first thing I thought was,  I want to run away.    </seg>
<seg id="8">   After seeing a few of these buildings --  there are many in the city --  we realized that they have three very big points.    </seg>
<seg id="9"> First, these buildings, they are almost empty  because they have very large shops  where people cannot afford to buy things.    </seg>
<seg id="10"> Second, they need tons of energy to perform  because of the skin treatment with glass  that creates heat in the inside,  and then you need a lot of cooling.    </seg>
<seg id="11"> In a city where this shouldn't happen  because they have really mild weather  that ranges from 20 to 25 degrees the whole year.    </seg>
<seg id="12"> And third is that their image has nothing to do  with Africa and with Ethiopia.    </seg>
<seg id="13"> It is a pity in a place that has such rich culture and traditions.    </seg>
<seg id="14"> Also during our first visit to Ethiopia,  I was really captivated by the old merkato  that is this open-air structure  where thousands of people, they go and buy things  every day from small vendors.    </seg>
<seg id="15"> And also it has this idea of the public space  that uses the outdoors to create activity.    </seg>
<seg id="16"> So I thought, this is what I really want to design,  not a shopping mall.    </seg>
<seg id="17"> But the question was how we could do a multistory,  contemporary building with these principles.    </seg>
<seg id="18"> The next challenge was when we looked at the site,  that is, in a really growing area of the city,  where most of these buildings that you see in the image,  they were not there.    </seg>
<seg id="19"> And it's also between two parallel streets  that don't have any connection for hundreds of meters.    </seg>
<seg id="20"> So the first thing we did was to create a connection  between these two streets,  putting all the entrances of the building.    </seg>
<seg id="21"> And this extends with an inclined atrium  that creates an open-air space in the building  that self-protects itself with its own shape  from the sun and the rain.    </seg>
<seg id="22"> And around this void  we placed this idea of the market with small shops,  that change in each floor because of the shape of the void.    </seg>
<seg id="23"> I also thought, how to close the building?    </seg>
<seg id="24"> And I really wanted to find a solution  that would respond to the local climate conditions.    </seg>
<seg id="25"> And I started thinking about the textile  like a shell made of concrete  with perforations that would let the air in,  and also the light, but in a filtered way.    </seg>
<seg id="26"> And then the inspiration came from these beautiful patterns of the Ethiopian women's dresses.    </seg>
<seg id="27"> That they have fractal geometry properties  and this helped me to shape the whole facade.    </seg>
<seg id="28"> And we are building that  with these small prefabricated pieces  that are the windows that let the air and the light  in a controlled way inside the building.    </seg>
<seg id="29"> And this is complemented by these small colored glasses  that use the light from the inside of the building  to light up the building at night.    </seg>
<seg id="30"> With these ideas it was not easy first to convince the developers  because they were like,  "This is not a shopping mall. We didn't ask for that."    </seg>
<seg id="31"> But then we all realized that this idea of the market  happened to be a lot more profitable than the idea of the shopping mall  because basically they had more shops to sell.    </seg>
<seg id="32"> And also that the idea of the facade was much, much cheaper,  not only because of the material compared with the glass,  but also because we didn't need to have air conditioning anymore.    </seg>
<seg id="33"> So we created some budget savings  that we used to implement the project.    </seg>
<seg id="34"> And the first implementation was to think  about how we could make the building self-sufficient in terms of energy  in a city that has electricity cuts almost every day.    </seg>
<seg id="35"> So we created a huge asset by placing photovoltaics there on the roof.    </seg>
<seg id="36"> And then under those panels  we thought about the roof like a new public space with gathering areas and bars  that would create this urban oasis.    </seg>
<seg id="37"> And these porches on the roof,  all together they collect the water to reuse for sanitation on the inside.    </seg>
<seg id="38"> Hopefully by the beginning of next year, because we are already on the fifth floor of the construction.    </seg>
<seg id="39"> The second example is a master plan  of 2,000 apartments and facilities in the city of Tunis.    </seg>
<seg id="40"> And for doing such a big project, the biggest project I've ever designed,  I really needed to understand the city of Tunis,  but also its surroundings and the tradition and culture.    </seg>
<seg id="41"> During that analysis I paid special attention to the medina  that is this 1,000-year-old structure that used to be closed by a wall,  opened by twelve different gates, connected by almost straight lines.    </seg>
<seg id="42"> When I went to the site, the first design operation we did  was to extend the existing streets, creating 12 initial blocks  similar in size and characteristics to the ones we have in Barcelona  and other cities in Europe with these courtyards.    </seg>
<seg id="43"> On top of that, we selected some strategic points  reminded of this idea of the gates and connecting them by straight lines,  and this modified this initial pattern.    </seg>
<seg id="44"> And the last operation was to think about the cell,  the small cell of the project, like the apartment,  as an essential part of the master plan.    </seg>
<seg id="45"> And for that I thought, what would be the best orientation  in the Mediterranean climate for an apartment?    </seg>
<seg id="46"> And it's north-south, because it creates a thermal difference between both sides of the house  and then a natural ventilation.    </seg>
<seg id="47"> So we overlap a pattern that makes sure that most of the apartments  are perfectly oriented in that direction.    </seg>
<seg id="48"> And this is the result  that is almost like a combination of the European block and the Arab city.    </seg>
<seg id="49"> It has these blocks with courtyards,  and then on the ground floor  you have all these connections for the pedestrians.    </seg>
<seg id="50"> And also it responds to the local regulations that establish  a higher density on the upper levels and a lower density on the ground floor.    </seg>
<seg id="51"> And it also reinforces this idea of the gates.    </seg>
<seg id="52"> The volume has this connecting shape  that shades itself with three different types of apartments  and also lets the light go on the ground floor in a very dense neighborhood  And in the courtyards there are the different facilities,  such as a gym and a kindergarten  and close by, a series of commercial [spaces] that bring activity to the ground floor.    </seg>
<seg id="53"> The roof, which is my favorite space of the project  is almost like giving back to the community the space taken by the construction.    </seg>
<seg id="54"> And it's where all the neighbors, they can go up and socialize,  and do activities such as having a two-kilometer run in the morning,  jumping from one building to another.    </seg>
<seg id="55"> These two examples,  they have a common approach in the design process.    </seg>
<seg id="56"> And also, they are in emerging countries where you can see  the cities literally growing.    </seg>
<seg id="57"> In these cities, the impact of architecture in people's lives of today and tomorrow  changes the local communities and economies at the same speed as the buildings grow.    </seg>
<seg id="58"> For this reason, I see even more importance  to look at architecture finding simple but affordable solutions  that enhance the relationship between the community and the environment  and that aim to connect nature and people.    </seg>
<seg id="59"> Thank you very much.    </seg>

<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: The border between our physical world and the digital information surrounding us has been getting thinner and thinner. Designer and engineer Jinha Lee wants to dissolve it altogether. As he demonstrates in this short, gasp-inducing talk, his ideas include a pen that penetrates into a screen to draw 3D models and SpaceTop, a computer desktop prototype that lets you reach through the screen to manipulate digital objects.</description>

<title>Jinha Lee: Reach into the computer and grab a pixel</title> 
<reviewer></reviewer> 
<translator></translator> 
<seg id="1"> Throughout the history of computers  we've been striving to shorten the gap between us  and digital information,  the gap between our physical world  and the world in the screen  where our imagination can go wild.    </seg>
<seg id="2"> And this gap has become shorter,  shorter, and even shorter,  and now this gap is shortened down  to less than a millimeter,  the thickness of a touch-screen glass,  and the power of computing  has become accessible to everyone.    </seg>
<seg id="3"> But I wondered, what if there could be no boundary at all?    </seg>
<seg id="4"> I started to imagine what this would look like.    </seg>
<seg id="5"> First, I created this tool  which penetrates into the digital space,  so when you press it hard on the screen,  it transfers its physical body into pixels.    </seg>
<seg id="6"> Designers can materialize their ideas  directly in 3D,  and surgeons can practice on virtual organs  underneath the screen.    </seg>
<seg id="7"> So with this tool, this boundary has been broken.    </seg>
<seg id="8"> But our two hands still remain outside the screen.    </seg>
<seg id="9"> How can you reach inside and interact  with the digital information  using the full dexterity of our hands?    </seg>
<seg id="10"> At Microsoft Applied Sciences,  along with my mentor Cati Boulanger,  I redesigned the computer  and turned a little space above the keyboard  into a digital workspace.    </seg>
<seg id="11"> By combining a transparent display and depth cameras  for sensing your fingers and face,  now you can lift up your hands from the keyboard  and reach inside this 3D space  and grab pixels with your bare hands.    </seg>
<seg id="12">   Because windows and files have a position in the real space,  selecting them is as easy as grabbing a book off your shelf.    </seg>
<seg id="13"> Then you can flip through this book  while highlighting the lines, words  on the virtual touch pad below each floating window.    </seg>
<seg id="14"> Architects can stretch or rotate the models  with their two hands directly.    </seg>
<seg id="15"> So in these examples,  we are reaching into the digital world.    </seg>
<seg id="16"> But how about reversing its role  and having the digital information reach us instead?    </seg>
<seg id="17"> I'm sure many of us have had the experience  of buying and returning items online.    </seg>
<seg id="18"> But now you don't have to worry about it.    </seg>
<seg id="19"> What I got here is an online augmented fitting room.    </seg>
<seg id="20"> This is a view that you get from  head-mounted or see-through display  when the system understands the geometry of your body.    </seg>
<seg id="21"> Taking this idea further, I started to think,  instead of just seeing these pixels in our space,  how can we make it physical  so that we can touch and feel it?    </seg>
<seg id="22"> What would such a future look like?    </seg>
<seg id="23"> At MIT Media Lab, along with my advisor Hiroshi Ishii  and my collaborator Rehmi Post,  we created this one physical pixel.    </seg>
<seg id="24"> Well, in this case, this spherical magnet  acts like a 3D pixel in our space,  which means that both computers and people  can move this object to anywhere  within this little 3D space.    </seg>
<seg id="25"> What we did was essentially canceling gravity  and controlling the movement by combining  magnetic levitation and mechanical actuation  and sensing technologies.    </seg>
<seg id="26"> And by digitally programming the object,  we are liberating the object from constraints  of time and space, which means that now,  human motions can be recorded and played back  and left permanently in the physical world.    </seg>
<seg id="27"> So choreography can be taught physically over distance  and Michael Jordan's famous shooting can be replicated  over and over as a physical reality.    </seg>
<seg id="28"> Students can use this as a tool  to learn about the complex concepts  such as planetary motion, physics,  and unlike computer screens or textbooks,  this is a real, tangible experience  that you can touch and feel, and it's very powerful.    </seg>
<seg id="29"> And what's more exciting  than just turning what's currently in the computer physical  is to start imagining how programming the world  will alter even our daily physical activities.    </seg>
<seg id="30">   As you can see, the digital information  will not just show us something  but it will start directly acting upon us  as a part of our physical surroundings  without disconnecting ourselves from our world.    </seg>
<seg id="31"> Today, we started by talking about the boundary,  but if we remove this boundary,  the only boundary left is our imagination.    </seg>
<seg id="32"> Thank you.    </seg>

<seg id="1"> So I was trained to become a gymnast  for two years in Hunan, China in the 1970s.    </seg>
<seg id="2"> When I was in the first grade, the government  wanted to transfer me to a school for athletes,  all expenses paid.    </seg>
<seg id="3"> But my tiger mother said, "No."    </seg>
<seg id="4"> My parents wanted me to become  an engineer like them.    </seg>
<seg id="5"> After surviving the Cultural Revolution,  they firmly believed there's only one sure way to happiness:  a safe and well-paid job.    </seg>
<seg id="6"> It is not important if I like the job or not.    </seg>
<seg id="7"> But my dream was to become a Chinese opera singer.    </seg>
<seg id="8"> That is me playing my imaginary piano.    </seg>
<seg id="9"> An opera singer must start training young  to learn acrobatics,  so I tried everything I could to go to opera school.    </seg>
<seg id="10"> I even wrote to the school principal  and the host of a radio show.    </seg>
<seg id="11"> But no adults liked the idea.    </seg>
<seg id="12"> No adults believed I was serious.    </seg>
<seg id="13"> Only my friends supported me, but they were kids,  just as powerless as I was.    </seg>
<seg id="14"> So at age 15, I knew I was too old to be trained.    </seg>
<seg id="15"> My dream would never come true.    </seg>
<seg id="16"> I was afraid that for the rest of my life  some second-class happiness  would be the best I could hope for.    </seg>
<seg id="17"> But that's so unfair.    </seg>
<seg id="18"> So I was determined to find another calling.    </seg>
<seg id="19"> Nobody around to teach me? Fine.    </seg>
<seg id="20"> I turned to books.    </seg>
<seg id="21"> I satisfied my hunger for parental advice  from this book by a family of writers and musicians.["Correspondence in the Family of Fou Lei"]  I found my role model of an independent woman  when Confucian tradition requires obedience.["Jane Eyre"]  And I learned to be efficient from this book.["Cheaper by the Dozen"]  And I was inspired to study abroad after reading these.    </seg>
<seg id="22"> ["Complete Works of Sanmao" (aka Echo Chan)] ["Lessons From History" by Nan Huaijin]  I came to the U.S. in 1995,  so which books did I read here first?    </seg>
<seg id="23"> Books banned in China, of course.    </seg>
<seg id="24"> "The Good Earth" is about Chinese peasant life.    </seg>
<seg id="25"> That's just not convenient for propaganda. Got it.    </seg>
<seg id="26"> The Bible is interesting, but strange.    </seg>
<seg id="27">   That's a topic for a different day.    </seg>
<seg id="28"> But the fifth commandment gave me an epiphany:  "You shall honor your father and mother."    </seg>
<seg id="29"> "Honor," I said. "That's so different,  and better, than obey."    </seg>
<seg id="30"> So it becomes my tool to climb out  of this Confucian guilt trap  and to restart my relationship with my parents.    </seg>
<seg id="31"> Encountering a new culture also started my habit  of comparative reading.    </seg>
<seg id="32"> It offers many insights.    </seg>
<seg id="33"> For example, I found this map out of place at first  because this is what Chinese students grew up with.    </seg>
<seg id="34"> It had never occurred to me,  China doesn't have to be at the center of the world.    </seg>
<seg id="35"> A map actually carries somebody's view.    </seg>
<seg id="36"> Comparative reading actually is nothing new.    </seg>
<seg id="37"> It's a standard practice in the academic world.    </seg>
<seg id="38"> There are even research fields  such as comparative religion and comparative literature.    </seg>
<seg id="39"> Compare and contrast gives scholars  a more complete understanding of a topic.    </seg>
<seg id="40"> So I thought, well, if comparative reading  works for research, why not do it in daily life too?    </seg>
<seg id="41"> So I started reading books in pairs.    </seg>
<seg id="42"> So they can be about people --  ["Benjamin Franklin" by Walter Isaacson]["John Adams" by David McCullough] --  who are involved in the same event,  or friends with shared experiences.    </seg>
<seg id="43"> ["Personal History" by Katharine Graham]["The Snowball: Warren Buffett and the Business of Life," by Alice Schroeder]  I also compare the same stories in different genres --   [Holy Bible: King James Version]["Lamb" by Chrisopher Moore] --  or similar stories from different cultures,  as Joseph Campbell did in his wonderful book.["The Power of Myth" by Joseph Campbell]    </seg>
<seg id="44"> For example, both the Christ and the Buddha  went through three temptations.    </seg>
<seg id="45"> For the Christ, the temptations  are economic, political and spiritual.    </seg>
<seg id="46"> For the Buddha, they are all psychological:  lust, fear and social duty -- interesting.    </seg>
<seg id="47"> So if you know a foreign language, it's also fun  to read your favorite books in two languages.    </seg>
<seg id="48"> ["The Way of Chuang Tzu" Thomas Merton]["Tao: The Watercourse Way" Alan Watts]  Instead of lost in translation, I found there is much to gain.    </seg>
<seg id="49"> For example, it's through translation that I realized  "happiness" in Chinese literally means "fast joy." Huh!    </seg>
<seg id="50"> "Bride" in Chinese literally means "new mother." Uh-oh.    </seg>
<seg id="51">   Books have given me a magic portal to connect with people  of the past and the present.    </seg>
<seg id="52"> I know I shall never feel lonely or powerless again.    </seg>
<seg id="53"> Having a dream shattered really is nothing  compared to what many others have suffered.    </seg>
<seg id="54"> I have come to believe that coming true  is not the only purpose of a dream.    </seg>
<seg id="55"> Its most important purpose is to get us in touch  with where dreams come from,  where passion comes from, where happiness comes from.    </seg>
<seg id="56"> Even a shattered dream can do that for you.    </seg>
<seg id="57"> So because of books, I'm here today,  happy, living again with a purpose and a clarity,  most of the time.    </seg>
<seg id="58"> So may books be always with you.    </seg>
<seg id="59"> Thank you.    </seg>
<seg id="60">   Thank you.   Thank you.     </seg>

<title>Angela Lee Duckworth: Grit: The power of passion and perseverance</title> 
<reviewer href="http://www.ted.com/profiles/1108408">Morton Bast</reviewer> 
<translator></translator> 
<seg id="1"> When I was 27 years old,  I left a very demanding job in management consulting  for a job that was even more demanding: teaching.    </seg>
<seg id="2"> I went to teach seventh graders math  in the New York City public schools.    </seg>
<seg id="3"> And like any teacher, I made quizzes and tests.    </seg>
<seg id="4"> I gave out homework assignments.    </seg>
<seg id="5"> When the work came back, I calculated grades.    </seg>
<seg id="6"> What struck me was that IQ was not the only difference  between my best and my worst students.    </seg>
<seg id="7"> Some of my strongest performers did not have stratospheric IQ scores.    </seg>
<seg id="8"> Some of my smartest kids weren't doing so well.    </seg>
<seg id="9"> And that got me thinking.    </seg>
<seg id="10"> The kinds of things you need to learn in seventh grade math,  sure, they're hard: ratios, decimals, the area of a parallelogram.    </seg>
<seg id="11"> But these concepts are not impossible,  and I was firmly convinced that every one of my students  could learn the material  if they worked hard and long enough.    </seg>
<seg id="12"> After several more years of teaching,  I came to the conclusion that what we need in education  is a much better understanding of students and learning  from a motivational perspective,  from a psychological perspective.    </seg>
<seg id="13"> In education, the one thing we know how to measure best is IQ.    </seg>
<seg id="14"> But what if doing well in school and in life  depends on much more  than your ability to learn quickly and easily?    </seg>
<seg id="15"> So I left the classroom,  and I went to graduate school to become a psychologist.    </seg>
<seg id="16"> I started studying kids and adults  in all kinds of super challenging settings,  and in every study my question was,  who is successful here and why?    </seg>
<seg id="17"> My research team and I went to West Point Military Academy.    </seg>
<seg id="18"> We tried to predict which cadets  would stay in military training and which would drop out.    </seg>
<seg id="19"> We went to the National Spelling Bee  and tried to predict which children would advance farthest in competition.    </seg>
<seg id="20"> We studied rookie teachers working in really tough neighborhoods,  asking which teachers are still going to be here in teaching  by the end of the school year,  and of those, who will be the most effective  at improving learning outcomes for their students?    </seg>
<seg id="21"> We partnered with private companies, asking,  which of these salespeople is going to keep their jobs?    </seg>
<seg id="22"> And who's going to earn the most money?    </seg>
<seg id="23"> In all those very different contexts,  one characteristic emerged as a significant predictor of success.    </seg>
<seg id="24"> And it wasn't social intelligence.    </seg>
<seg id="25"> It wasn't good looks, physical health, and it wasn't IQ.    </seg>
<seg id="26"> It was grit.    </seg>
<seg id="27"> Grit is passion and perseverance for very long-term goals.    </seg>
<seg id="28"> Grit is having stamina.    </seg>
<seg id="29"> Grit is sticking with your future, day in, day out,  not just for the week, not just for the month,  but for years,  and working really hard to make that future a reality.    </seg>
<seg id="30"> Grit is living life like it's a marathon, not a sprint.    </seg>
<seg id="31"> A few years ago,  I started studying grit in the Chicago public schools.    </seg>
<seg id="32"> I asked thousands of high school juniors  to take grit questionnaires,  and then waited around more than a year  to see who would graduate.    </seg>
<seg id="33"> Turns out that grittier kids  were significantly more likely to graduate,  even when I matched them on every characteristic I could measure,  things like family income,  standardized achievement test scores,  even how safe kids felt when they were at school.    </seg>
<seg id="34"> So it's not just at West Point or the National Spelling Bee  that grit matters. It's also in school,  especially for kids at risk for dropping out.    </seg>
<seg id="35"> To me, the most shocking thing about grit  is how little we know,  how little science knows, about building it.    </seg>
<seg id="36"> Every day, parents and teachers ask me,  "How do I build grit in kids?    </seg>
<seg id="37"> What do I do to teach kids a solid work ethic?    </seg>
<seg id="38"> How do I keep them motivated for the long run?"    </seg>
<seg id="39"> The honest answer is, I don't know.   What I do know is that talent doesn't make you gritty.    </seg>
<seg id="40"> Our data show very clearly  that there are many talented individuals  who simply do not follow through on their commitments.    </seg>
<seg id="41"> In fact, in our data, grit is usually unrelated  or even inversely related to measures of talent.    </seg>
<seg id="42"> So far, the best idea I've heard about building grit in kids  is something called "growth mindset."    </seg>
<seg id="43"> This is an idea developed at Stanford University by Carol Dweck,  and it is the belief that the ability to learn is not fixed,  that it can change with your effort.    </seg>
<seg id="44"> Dr. Dweck has shown  that when kids read and learn about the brain  and how it changes and grows in response to challenge,  they're much more likely to persevere when they fail,  because they don't believe that failure is a permanent condition.    </seg>
<seg id="45"> So growth mindset is a great idea for building grit.    </seg>
<seg id="46"> But we need more.    </seg>
<seg id="47"> And that's where I'm going to end my remarks,  because that's where we are.    </seg>
<seg id="48"> That's the work that stands before us.    </seg>
<seg id="49"> We need to take our best ideas, our strongest intuitions,  and we need to test them.    </seg>
<seg id="50"> We need to measure whether we've been successful,  and we have to be willing to fail, to be wrong,  to start over again with lessons learned.    </seg>
<seg id="51"> In other words, we need to be gritty  about getting our kids grittier.    </seg>
<seg id="52"> Thank you.    </seg>

<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: For foreigners, learning to speak Chinese is a hard task. But learning to read the beautiful, often complex characters of the Chinese written language may be less difficult. ShaoLan walks through a simple lesson in recognizing the ideas behind the characters and their meaning -- building from a few simple forms to more complex concepts. Call it Chineasy.</description>

<title>ShaoLan: Learn to read Chinese ... with ease!</title> 
<reviewer href="http://www.ted.com/profiles/1108408">Morton Bast</reviewer> 
<translator></translator> 
<seg id="1"> Growing up in Taiwan  as the daughter of a calligrapher,  one of my most treasured memories  was my mother showing me the beauty, the shape  and the form of Chinese characters.    </seg>
<seg id="2"> Ever since then, I was fascinated  by this incredible language.    </seg>
<seg id="3"> But to an outsider, it seems to be  as impenetrable as the Great Wall of China.    </seg>
<seg id="4"> Over the past few years, I've been wondering  if I can break down this wall,  so anyone who wants to understand and appreciate  the beauty of this sophisticated language could do so.    </seg>
<seg id="5"> I started thinking about how a new, fast method  of learning Chinese might be useful.    </seg>
<seg id="6"> Since the age of five, I started to learn how to draw  every single stroke for each character  in the correct sequence.    </seg>
<seg id="7"> I learned new characters every day  during the course of the next 15 years.    </seg>
<seg id="8"> Since we only have five minutes,  it's better that we have a fast and simpler way.    </seg>
<seg id="9"> A Chinese scholar would understand 20,000 characters.    </seg>
<seg id="10"> You only need 1,000 to understand the basic literacy.    </seg>
<seg id="11"> The top 200 will allow you to comprehend  40 percent of basic literature --  enough to read road signs, restaurant menus,  to understand the basic idea of the web pages  or the newspapers.    </seg>
<seg id="12"> Today I'm going to start with eight  to show you how the method works.    </seg>
<seg id="13"> You are ready?    </seg>
<seg id="14"> Open your mouth as wide as possible  until it's square.    </seg>
<seg id="15"> You get a mouth.    </seg>
<seg id="16"> This is a person going for a walk.    </seg>
<seg id="17"> Person.    </seg>
<seg id="18"> If the shape of the fire is a person  with two arms on both sides,  as if she was yelling frantically,  "Help! I'm on fire!" --  This symbol actually is originally from the shape of the flame,  but I like to think that way. Whichever works for you.    </seg>
<seg id="19"> This is a tree.    </seg>
<seg id="20"> Tree.    </seg>
<seg id="21"> This is a mountain.    </seg>
<seg id="22"> The sun.    </seg>
<seg id="23"> The moon.    </seg>
<seg id="24"> The symbol of the door  looks like a pair of saloon doors in the wild west.    </seg>
<seg id="25"> I call these eight characters radicals.    </seg>
<seg id="26"> They are the building blocks  for you to create lots more characters.    </seg>
<seg id="27"> A person.    </seg>
<seg id="28"> If someone walks behind, that is "to follow."    </seg>
<seg id="29"> As the old saying goes,  two is company, three is a crowd.    </seg>
<seg id="30"> If a person stretched their arms wide,  this person is saying, "It was this big."    </seg>
<seg id="31"> The person inside the mouth, the person is trapped.    </seg>
<seg id="32"> He's a prisoner, just like Jonah inside the whale.    </seg>
<seg id="33"> One tree is a tree. Two trees together, we have the woods.    </seg>
<seg id="34"> Three trees together, we create the forest.    </seg>
<seg id="35"> Put a plank underneath the tree, we have the foundation.    </seg>
<seg id="36"> Put a mouth on the top of the tree, that's "idiot."   Easy to remember,  since a talking tree is pretty idiotic.    </seg>
<seg id="37"> Remember fire?    </seg>
<seg id="38"> Two fires together, I get really hot.    </seg>
<seg id="39"> Three fires together, that's a lot of flames.    </seg>
<seg id="40"> Set the fire underneath the two trees, it's burning.    </seg>
<seg id="41"> For us, the sun is the source of prosperity.    </seg>
<seg id="42"> Two suns together, prosperous.    </seg>
<seg id="43"> Three together, that's sparkles.    </seg>
<seg id="44"> Put the sun and the moon shining together,  it's brightness.    </seg>
<seg id="45"> It also means tomorrow, after a day and a night.    </seg>
<seg id="46"> The sun is coming up above the horizon. Sunrise.    </seg>
<seg id="47"> A door. Put a plank inside the door,  it's a door bolt.    </seg>
<seg id="48"> Put a mouth inside the door, asking questions.    </seg>
<seg id="49"> Knock knock. Is anyone home?    </seg>
<seg id="50"> This person is sneaking out of a door,  escaping, evading.    </seg>
<seg id="51"> On the left, we have a woman.    </seg>
<seg id="52"> Two women together, they have an argument.    </seg>
<seg id="53">   Three women together, be careful, it's adultery.    </seg>
<seg id="54"> So we have gone through almost 30 characters.    </seg>
<seg id="55"> By using this method, the first eight radicals  will allow you to build 32.    </seg>
<seg id="56"> The next group of eight characters  will build an extra 32.    </seg>
<seg id="57"> So with very little effort,  you will be able to learn a couple hundred characters,  which is the same as a Chinese eight-year-old.    </seg>
<seg id="58"> So after we know the characters, we start building phrases.    </seg>
<seg id="59"> For example, the mountain and the fire together,  we have fire mountain. It's a volcano.    </seg>
<seg id="60"> We know Japan is the land of the rising sun.    </seg>
<seg id="61"> This is a sun placed with the origin,  because Japan lies to the east of China.    </seg>
<seg id="62"> So a sun, origin together, we build Japan.    </seg>
<seg id="63"> A person behind Japan, what do we get?    </seg>
<seg id="64"> A Japanese person.    </seg>
<seg id="65"> The character on the left is two mountains  stacked on top of each other.    </seg>
<seg id="66"> In ancient China, that means in exile,  because Chinese emperors, they put their political enemies  in exile beyond mountains.    </seg>
<seg id="67"> Nowadays, exile has turned into getting out.    </seg>
<seg id="68"> A mouth which tells you where to get out  is an exit.    </seg>
<seg id="69"> This is a slide to remind me that I should stop talking  and get off of the stage. Thank you.    </seg>

<title>Colin Stokes: How movies teach manhood</title> 
<reviewer href="http://www.ted.com/profiles/1020352">Thu-Huong Ha</reviewer> 
<translator></translator> 
<seg id="1"> You know, my favorite part of being a dad  is the movies I get to watch.    </seg>
<seg id="2"> I love sharing my favorite movies with my kids,  and when my daughter was four,  we got to watch "The Wizard of Oz" together.    </seg>
<seg id="3"> It totally dominated her imagination for months.    </seg>
<seg id="4"> Her favorite character was Glinda, of course.    </seg>
<seg id="5"> It gave her a great excuse to wear a sparkly dress  and carry a wand.    </seg>
<seg id="6"> But you watch that movie enough times,  and you start to realize how unusual it is.    </seg>
<seg id="7"> Now we live today, and are raising our children,  in a kind of children's-fantasy-spectacular-industrial complex.    </seg>
<seg id="8"> But "The Wizard of Oz" stood alone.    </seg>
<seg id="9"> It did not start that trend.    </seg>
<seg id="10"> Forty years later was when the trend really caught on,  with, interestingly, another movie  that featured a metal guy  and a furry guy  rescuing a girl by dressing up as the enemy's guards.    </seg>
<seg id="11"> Do you know what I'm talking about?   Yeah.    </seg>
<seg id="12"> Now, there's a big difference between these two movies,  a couple of really big differences between "The Wizard of Oz"  and all the movies we watch today.    </seg>
<seg id="13"> One is there's very little violence in "The Wizard of Oz."    </seg>
<seg id="14"> The monkeys are rather aggressive, as are the apple trees.    </seg>
<seg id="15"> But I think if "The Wizard of Oz" were made today,  the wizard would say, "Dorothy, you are the savior of Oz  that the prophecy foretold.    </seg>
<seg id="16"> Use your magic slippers to defeat  the computer-generated armies of the Wicked Witch."    </seg>
<seg id="17"> But that's not how it happens.    </seg>
<seg id="18"> Another thing that's really unique about "The Wizard of Oz"  to me is that all of the most heroic  and wise and even villainous characters  are female.    </seg>
<seg id="19"> Now I started to notice this  when I actually showed "Star Wars" to my daughter,  which was years later, and the situation was different.    </seg>
<seg id="20"> At that point I also had a son.    </seg>
<seg id="21"> He was only three at the time.    </seg>
<seg id="22"> He was not invited to the screening. He was too young for that.    </seg>
<seg id="23"> But he was the second child,  and the level of supervision had plummeted.   So he wandered in,  and it imprinted on him  like a mommy duck does to its duckling,  and I don't think he understands what's going on,  but he is sure soaking in it.    </seg>
<seg id="24"> And I wonder what he's soaking in.    </seg>
<seg id="25"> Is he picking up on the themes of courage  and perseverance and loyalty?    </seg>
<seg id="26"> Is he picking up on the fact that Luke  joins an army to overthrow the government?    </seg>
<seg id="27"> Is he picking up on the fact that  there are only boys in the universe  except for Aunt Beru, and of course this princess,  who's really cool, but who kind of waits around through most of the movie  so that she can award the hero with a medal and a wink  to thank him for saving the universe, which he does    </seg>
<seg id="28"> by the magic that he was born with?    </seg>
<seg id="29"> Compare this to 1939 with "The Wizard of Oz."    </seg>
<seg id="30"> How does Dorothy win her movie?    </seg>
<seg id="31"> By making friends with everybody  and being a leader.    </seg>
<seg id="32"> That's kind of the world I'd rather raise my kids in --  Oz, right? -- and not the world of dudes fighting,  which is where we kind of have to be.    </seg>
<seg id="33"> Why is there so much Force -- capital F, Force --  in the movies we have for our kids,  and so little yellow brick road?    </seg>
<seg id="34"> There is a lot of great writing about the impact  that the boy-violent movie has on girls,  and you should do that reading. It's very good.    </seg>
<seg id="35"> I haven't read as much on how boys are picking up on this vibe.    </seg>
<seg id="36"> I know from my own experience that  Princess Leia did not provide the adequate context  that I could have used in navigating the adult world  that is co-ed.   I think there was a first-kiss moment  when I really expected the credits to start rolling  because that's the end of the movie, right?    </seg>
<seg id="37"> I finished my quest, I got the girl.    </seg>
<seg id="38"> Why are you still standing there?    </seg>
<seg id="39"> I don't know what I'm supposed to do.    </seg>
<seg id="40"> The movies are very, very focused on defeating the villain  and getting your reward, and there's not a lot of room  for other relationships and other journeys.    </seg>
<seg id="41"> It's almost as though if you're a boy,  you are a dopey animal,  and if you are a girl, you should bring your warrior costume.    </seg>
<seg id="42"> There are plenty of exceptions,  and I will defend the Disney princesses in front of any you.    </seg>
<seg id="43"> But they do send a message to boys,  that they are not, the boys are not really the target audience.    </seg>
<seg id="44"> They are doing a phenomenal job of teaching girls  how to defend against the patriarchy,  but they are not necessarily showing boys  how they're supposed to defend against the patriarchy.    </seg>
<seg id="45"> There's no models for them.    </seg>
<seg id="46"> And we also have some terrific women  who are writing new stories for our kids,  and as three-dimensional and delightful as Hermione and Katniss are,  these are still war movies.    </seg>
<seg id="47"> And, of course, the most successful studio of all time  continues to crank out classic after classic,  every single one of them about  the journey of a boy, or a man,  or two men who are friends, or a man and his son,  or two men who are raising a little girl.    </seg>
<seg id="48"> Until, as many of you are thinking, this year,  when they finally came out with "Brave."    </seg>
<seg id="49"> I recommend it to all of you. It's on demand now.    </seg>
<seg id="50"> Do you remember what the critics said when "Brave" came out?    </seg>
<seg id="51"> "Aw, I can't believe Pixar made a princess movie."    </seg>
<seg id="52"> It's very good. Don't let that stop you.    </seg>
<seg id="53"> Now, almost none of these movies pass the Bechdel Test.    </seg>
<seg id="54"> I don't know if you've heard of this.    </seg>
<seg id="55"> It has not yet caught on and caught fire,  but maybe today we will start a movement.    </seg>
<seg id="56"> Alison Bechdel is a comic book artist,  and back in the mid-'80s, she recorded this conversation  she'd had with a friend about assessing the movies that they saw.    </seg>
<seg id="57"> And it's very simple. There's just three questions you should ask:  Is there more than one character in the movie  that is female who has lines?    </seg>
<seg id="58"> So try to meet that bar.    </seg>
<seg id="59"> And do these women talk to each other at any point in the movie?    </seg>
<seg id="60"> And is their conversation about something other than  the guy that they both like?   Right? Thank you.   Thank you very much.    </seg>
<seg id="61"> Two women who exist and talk to each other about stuff.    </seg>
<seg id="62"> It does happen. I've seen it,  and yet I very rarely see it in the movies  that we know and love.    </seg>
<seg id="63"> In fact, this week I went to see  a very high-quality movie, "Argo."    </seg>
<seg id="64"> Right? Oscar buzz, doing great at the box office,  a consensus idea of what a quality Hollywood film is.    </seg>
<seg id="65"> It pretty much flunks the Bechdel test.    </seg>
<seg id="66"> And I don't think it should, because a lot of the movie,  I don't know if you've seen it, but a lot of the movie  takes place in this embassy where men and women  are hiding out during the hostage crisis.    </seg>
<seg id="67"> We've got quite a few scenes of the men  having deep, angst-ridden conversations in this hideout,  and the great moment for one of the actresses is  to peek through the door and say, "Are you coming to bed, honey?"    </seg>
<seg id="68"> That's Hollywood for you.    </seg>
<seg id="69"> So let's look at the numbers.    </seg>
<seg id="70"> 2011, of the 100 most popular movies,  how many of them do you think actually have female protagonists?    </seg>
<seg id="71"> Eleven. It's not bad.    </seg>
<seg id="72"> It's not as many percent as the number of women  we've just elected to Congress, so that's good.    </seg>
<seg id="73"> But there is a number that is greater than this  that's going to bring this room down.    </seg>
<seg id="74"> Last year, The New York Times published a study  that the government had done.    </seg>
<seg id="75"> Here's what it said.    </seg>
<seg id="76"> One out of five women in America  say that they have been sexually assaulted some time in their life.    </seg>
<seg id="77"> Now, I don't think that's the fault of popular entertainment.    </seg>
<seg id="78"> I don't think kids' movies have anything to do with that.    </seg>
<seg id="79"> I don't even think that  music videos or pornography are really directly related to that,  but something is going wrong,  and when I hear that statistic,  one of the things I think of is  that's a lot of sexual assailants.    </seg>
<seg id="80"> Who are these guys? What are they learning?    </seg>
<seg id="81"> What are they failing to learn?    </seg>
<seg id="82"> Are they absorbing the story that  a male hero's job is to defeat the villain with violence  and then collect the reward, which is a woman  who has no friends and doesn't speak?    </seg>
<seg id="83"> Are we soaking up that story?    </seg>
<seg id="84"> You know,  as a parent with the privilege  of raising a daughter  like all of you who are doing the same thing,  we find this world and this statistic very alarming  and we want to prepare them.    </seg>
<seg id="85"> We have tools at our disposal like "girl power,"  and we hope that that will help,  but I gotta wonder, is girl power going to protect them  if, at the same time, actively or passively,  we are training our sons to maintain their boy power?    </seg>
<seg id="86"> I mean, I think the Netflix queue  is one way that we can do something very important,  and I'm talking mainly to the dads here.    </seg>
<seg id="87"> I think we have got to show our sons  a new definition of manhood.    </seg>
<seg id="88"> The definition of manhood is already turning upside down.    </seg>
<seg id="89"> You've read about how the new economy  is changing the roles of caregiver and wage earner.    </seg>
<seg id="90"> They're throwing it up in the air.    </seg>
<seg id="91"> So our sons are going to have to find some way  of adapting to this, some new relationship with each other,  and I think we really have to show them, and model for them,  how a real man  is someone who trusts his sisters  and respects them, and wants to be on their team,  and stands up against the real bad guys,    </seg>
<seg id="92"> who are the men who want to abuse the women.    </seg>
<seg id="93"> And I think our job in the Netflix queue  is to look out for those movies that pass the Bechdel Test,  if we can find them, and to seek out the heroines  who are there,  who show real courage, who bring people together,  and to nudge our sons to identify with those heroines  and to say, "I want to be on their team,"    </seg>
<seg id="94"> because they're going to be on their team.    </seg>
<seg id="95"> When I asked my daughter who her favorite character was in "Star Wars,"  do you know what she said?    </seg>
<seg id="96"> Obi-Wan.    </seg>
<seg id="97"> Obi-Wan Kenobi and Glinda.    </seg>
<seg id="98"> What do these two have in common?    </seg>
<seg id="99"> Maybe it's not just the sparkly dress.    </seg>
<seg id="100"> I think these people are experts.    </seg>
<seg id="101"> I think these are the two people in the movie  who know more than anybody else,  and they love sharing their knowledge with other people  to help them reach their potential.    </seg>
<seg id="102"> Now, they are leaders.    </seg>
<seg id="103"> I like that kind of quest for my daughter,  and I like that kind of quest for my son.    </seg>
<seg id="104"> I want more quests like that.    </seg>
<seg id="105"> I want fewer quests where my son is told,  "Go out and fight it alone,"  and more quests where he sees that it's his job to join a team,  maybe a team led by women,  to help other people become better  and be better people,  like the Wizard of Oz.    </seg>
<seg id="106"> Thank you.    </seg>

<title>Sarah Parcak: Archaeology from space</title>

<translator></translator> 
<seg id="1"> When I was a child growing up in Maine,  one of my favorite things to do  was to look for sand dollars on the seashores of Maine,  because my parents told me it would bring me luck.    </seg>
<seg id="2"> But you know, these shells, they're hard to find.    </seg>
<seg id="3"> They're covered in sand, they're difficult to see.    </seg>
<seg id="4"> However, over time, I got used to looking for them.    </seg>
<seg id="5"> I started seeing shapes  and patterns that helped me to collect them.    </seg>
<seg id="6"> This grew into a passion for finding things,  a love for the past and archaeology.    </seg>
<seg id="7"> And eventually, when I started studying Egyptology,  I realized that seeing with my naked eyes alone wasn't enough.    </seg>
<seg id="8"> Because all of the sudden, in Egypt,  my beach had grown from a tiny beach in Maine  to one eight hundred miles long,  next to the Nile.    </seg>
<seg id="9"> And my sand dollars had grown to the size of cities.    </seg>
<seg id="10"> This is really what brought me to using satellite imagery.    </seg>
<seg id="11"> For trying to map the past, I knew that I had to see differently.    </seg>
<seg id="12"> So I want to show you an example of how we see differently  using the infrared.    </seg>
<seg id="13"> This is a site located in the eastern Egyptian delta  called Mendes.    </seg>
<seg id="14"> And the site visibly appears brown,  but when we use the infrared  and we process it, all of the sudden, using false color,  the site appears as bright pink.    </seg>
<seg id="15"> What you are seeing  are the actual chemical changes to the landscape  caused by the building materials and activities  of the ancient Egyptians.    </seg>
<seg id="16"> What I want to share with you today  is how we've used satellite data  to find an ancient Egyptian city,  called Itjtawy,  missing for thousands of years.    </seg>
<seg id="17"> Itjtawy was ancient Egypt's capital  for over four hundred years,  at a period of time called the Middle Kingdom,  about four thousand years ago.    </seg>
<seg id="18"> The site is located in the Faiyum of Egypt,  and the site is really important,  because in the Middle Kingdom there was this great renaissance  for ancient Egyptian art, architecture and religion.    </seg>
<seg id="19"> Egyptologists have always known the site of Itjtawy  was located somewhere near the pyramids of the two kings who built it,  indicated within the red circles here,  but somewhere within this massive flood plain.    </seg>
<seg id="20"> This area is huge --  it's four miles by three miles in size.    </seg>
<seg id="21"> The Nile used to flow right next to the city of Itjtawy,  and as it shifted and changed and moved over time to the east,  it covered over the city.    </seg>
<seg id="22"> So, how do you find a buried city  in a vast landscape?    </seg>
<seg id="23"> Finding it randomly would be the equivalent  of locating a needle in a haystack,  blindfolded, wearing baseball mitts.    </seg>
<seg id="24"> So what we did is we used NASA topography data  to map out the landscape, very subtle changes.    </seg>
<seg id="25"> We started to be able to see where the Nile used to flow.    </seg>
<seg id="26"> But you can see in more detail, and even more interesting,  this very slight raised area  seen within the circle up here  which we thought could possibly be the location of the city of Itjtawy.    </seg>
<seg id="27"> So we collaborated with Egyptian scientists  to do coring work, which you see here.    </seg>
<seg id="28"> When I say coring, it's like ice coring,  but instead of layers of climate change, you're looking for layers of human occupation.    </seg>
<seg id="29"> And, five meters down,  underneath a thick layer of mud,  we found a dense layer of pottery.    </seg>
<seg id="30"> What this shows is that at this possible location of Itjtawy,  five meters down,  we have a layer of occupation for several hundred years,  dating to the exact period of time we think Itjtawy is.    </seg>
<seg id="31"> We also found work stone --  carnelian, quartz and agate  that shows that there was a jeweler's workshop here.    </seg>
<seg id="32"> These might not look like much,  but when you think about the most common stones  used in jewelry from the Middle Kingdom,  these are the stones that were used.    </seg>
<seg id="33"> So, we have a dense layer of occupation  dating to the Middle Kingdom at this site.    </seg>
<seg id="34"> We also have evidence of an elite jeweler's workshop,  showing that whatever was there was a very important city.    </seg>
<seg id="35"> No Itjtawy was here yet,  but we're going to be returning to the site  in the near future to map it out.    </seg>
<seg id="36"> And even more importantly,  we have funding to train young Egyptians in the use of satellite technology  so they can be the ones making great discoveries as well.    </seg>
<seg id="37"> So I wanted to end with my favorite quote from the Middle Kingdom --  it was probably written at the city of Itjtawy  four thousand years ago.    </seg>
<seg id="38"> "Sharing knowledge is the greatest of all callings.    </seg>
<seg id="39"> There's nothing like it in the land."    </seg>
<seg id="40"> So as it turns out, TED was not founded in 1984 AD.    </seg>
<seg id="41">   Making ideas actually started in 1984 BC  at a not-lost-for-long city, found from above.    </seg>
<seg id="42"> It certainly puts finding seashells by the seashore in perspective.    </seg>
<seg id="43"> Thank you very much.    </seg>
<seg id="44">   Thank you.    </seg>

<seg id="1"> I'd like to invite you to close your eyes.    </seg>
<seg id="2"> Imagine yourself standing outside the front door of your home.    </seg>
<seg id="3"> I'd like you to notice the color of the door,  the material that it's made out of.    </seg>
<seg id="4"> Now visualize a pack of overweight nudists on bicycles.    </seg>
<seg id="5"> They are competing in a naked bicycle race,  and they are headed straight for your front door.    </seg>
<seg id="6"> I need you to actually see this.    </seg>
<seg id="7"> They are pedaling really hard, they're sweaty,  they're bouncing around a lot.    </seg>
<seg id="8"> And they crash straight into the front door of your home.    </seg>
<seg id="9"> Bicycles fly everywhere, wheels roll past you,  spokes end up in awkward places.    </seg>
<seg id="10"> Step over the threshold of your door into your foyer, your hallway,  whatever's on the other side,  and appreciate the quality of the light.    </seg>
<seg id="11"> The light is shining down on Cookie Monster.    </seg>
<seg id="12"> Cookie Monster is waving at you from his perch on top of a tan horse.    </seg>
<seg id="13"> It's a talking horse.    </seg>
<seg id="14"> You can practically feel his blue fur tickling your nose.    </seg>
<seg id="15"> You can smell the oatmeal raisin cookie that he's about to shovel into his mouth.    </seg>
<seg id="16"> Walk past him into your living room.    </seg>
<seg id="17"> In your living room, in full imaginative broadband,  picture Britney Spears.    </seg>
<seg id="18"> She is scantily clad, she's dancing on your coffee table,  and she's singing "Hit Me Baby One More Time."    </seg>
<seg id="19"> And then, follow me into your kitchen.    </seg>
<seg id="20"> In your kitchen, the floor has been paved over with a yellow brick road,  and out of your oven are coming towards you Dorothy, the Tin Man,  the Scarecrow and the Lion from "The Wizard of Oz,"  hand-in-hand, skipping straight towards you.    </seg>
<seg id="21"> Okay. Open your eyes.    </seg>
<seg id="22"> I want to tell you about a very bizarre contest  that is held every spring in New York City.    </seg>
<seg id="23"> It's called the United States Memory Championship.    </seg>
<seg id="24"> And I had gone to cover this contest a few years back  as a science journalist,  expecting, I guess, that this was going to be like the Superbowl of savants.    </seg>
<seg id="25"> This was a bunch of guys and a few ladies,  widely varying in both age and hygienic upkeep.    </seg>
<seg id="26">   They were memorizing hundreds of random numbers,  looking at them just once.    </seg>
<seg id="27"> They were memorizing the names of dozens and dozens and dozens of strangers.    </seg>
<seg id="28"> They were memorizing entire poems in just a few minutes.    </seg>
<seg id="29"> They were competing to see who could memorize  the order of a shuffled pack of playing cards the fastest.    </seg>
<seg id="30"> I was like, this is unbelievable.    </seg>
<seg id="31"> These people must be freaks of nature.    </seg>
<seg id="32"> And I started talking to a few of the competitors.    </seg>
<seg id="33"> This is a guy called Ed Cook, who had come over from England,  where he had one of the best-trained memories.    </seg>
<seg id="34"> And I said to him, "Ed, when did you realize  that you were a savant?"    </seg>
<seg id="35"> And Ed was like, "I'm not a savant.    </seg>
<seg id="36"> In fact, I have just an average memory.    </seg>
<seg id="37"> Everybody who competes in this contest will tell you  that they have just an average memory.    </seg>
<seg id="38"> We've all trained ourselves to perform these utterly miraculous feats of memory  using a set of ancient techniques,  techniques invented 2,500 years ago in Greece,  the same techniques that Cicero had used to memorize his speeches,  that medieval scholars had used to memorize entire books."    </seg>
<seg id="39"> And I said, "Whoa. How come I never heard of this before?"    </seg>
<seg id="40"> And we were standing outside the competition hall,  and Ed, who is a wonderful, brilliant, but somewhat eccentric English guy,  says to me, "Josh, you're an American journalist.    </seg>
<seg id="41"> Do you know Britney Spears?"    </seg>
<seg id="42"> I'm like, "What? No. Why?"    </seg>
<seg id="43"> "Because I really want to teach Britney Spears  how to memorize the order of a shuffled pack of playing cards  on U.S. national television.    </seg>
<seg id="44"> It will prove to the world that anybody can do this."    </seg>
<seg id="45">   I was like, "Well, I'm not Britney Spears,  but maybe you could teach me.    </seg>
<seg id="46"> I mean, you've got to start somewhere, right?"    </seg>
<seg id="47"> And that was the beginning of a very strange journey for me.    </seg>
<seg id="48"> I ended up spending the better part of the next year  not only training my memory,  but also investigating it,  trying to understand how it works,  why it sometimes doesn't work,  and what its potential might be.    </seg>
<seg id="49"> And I met a host of really interesting people.    </seg>
<seg id="50"> This is a guy called E.P.    </seg>
<seg id="51"> He's an amnesic who had, very possibly,  the worst memory in the world.    </seg>
<seg id="52"> His memory was so bad,  that he didn't even remember he had a memory problem,  which is amazing.    </seg>
<seg id="53"> And he was this incredibly tragic figure,  but he was a window into the extent to which our memories make us who we are.    </seg>
<seg id="54"> At the other end of the spectrum, I met this guy.    </seg>
<seg id="55"> This is Kim Peek, he was the basis for Dustin Hoffman's character  in the movie "Rain Man."    </seg>
<seg id="56"> We spent an afternoon together in the Salt Lake City Public Library memorizing phone books,  which was scintillating.    </seg>
<seg id="57">   And I went back and I read a whole host of memory treatises,  treatises written 2,000-plus years ago in Latin,  in antiquity, and then later, in the Middle Ages.    </seg>
<seg id="58"> And I learned a whole bunch of really interesting stuff.    </seg>
<seg id="59"> One of the really interesting things that I learned  is that once upon a time,  this idea of having a trained, disciplined, cultivated memory  was not nearly so alien as it would seem to us to be today.    </seg>
<seg id="60"> Once upon a time, people invested in their memories,  in laboriously furnishing their minds.    </seg>
<seg id="61"> Over the last few millenia,  we've invented a series of technologies --  from the alphabet, to the scroll,  to the codex, the printing press, photography,  the computer, the smartphone --  that have made it progressively easier and easier  for us to externalize our memories,  for us to essentially outsource this fundamental human capacity.    </seg>
<seg id="62"> These technologies have made our modern world possible,  but they've also changed us.    </seg>
<seg id="63"> They've changed us culturally,  and I would argue that they've changed us cognitively.    </seg>
<seg id="64"> Having little need to remember anymore,  it sometimes seems like we've forgotten how.    </seg>
<seg id="65"> One of the last places on Earth where you still find  people passionate about this idea of a trained, disciplined, cultivated memory,  is at this totally singular memory contest.    </seg>
<seg id="66"> It's actually not that singular,  there are contests held all over the world.    </seg>
<seg id="67"> And I was fascinated, I wanted to know how do these guys do it.    </seg>
<seg id="68"> A few years back a group of researchers at University College London  brought a bunch of memory champions into the lab.    </seg>
<seg id="69"> They wanted to know:  Do these guys have brains that are somehow structurally,  anatomically different from the rest of ours?    </seg>
<seg id="70"> The answer was no.    </seg>
<seg id="71"> Are they smarter than the rest of us?    </seg>
<seg id="72"> They gave them a bunch of cognitive tests, and the answer was: not really.    </seg>
<seg id="73"> There was, however, one really interesting and telling difference  between the brains of the memory champions  and the control subjects that they were comparing them to.    </seg>
<seg id="74"> When they put these guys in an fMRI machine,  scanned their brains while they were memorizing numbers  and people's faces and pictures of snowflakes,  they found that the memory champions were lighting up different parts of the brain  than everyone else.    </seg>
<seg id="75"> Of note, they were using, or they seemed to be using,  a part of the brain that's involved in spatial memory and navigation.    </seg>
<seg id="76"> Why? And is there something that the rest of us can learn from this?    </seg>
<seg id="77"> The sport of competitive memorizing is driven by a kind of arms race where,  every year, somebody comes up with a new way to remember more stuff more quickly,  and then the rest of the field has to play catch-up.    </seg>
<seg id="78"> This is my friend Ben Pridmore,  three-time world memory champion.    </seg>
<seg id="79"> On his desk in front of him are 36 shuffled packs of playing cards  that he is about to try to memorize in one hour,  using a technique that he invented and he alone has mastered.    </seg>
<seg id="80"> He used a similar technique  to memorize the precise order of 4,140 random binary digits  in half an hour.    </seg>
<seg id="81"> Yeah.    </seg>
<seg id="82"> And while there are a whole host of ways  of remembering stuff in these competitions,  everything, all of the techniques that are being used,  ultimately come down to a concept  that psychologists refer to as "elaborative encoding."    </seg>
<seg id="83"> And it's well-illustrated by a nifty paradox  known as the Baker/baker paradox, which goes like this:  If I tell two people to remember the same word,  if I say to you,  "Remember that there is a guy named Baker."    </seg>
<seg id="84"> That's his name.    </seg>
<seg id="85"> And I say to you, "Remember that there is a guy who is a baker."    </seg>
<seg id="86"> And I come back to you at some point later on,  and I say, "Do you remember that word that I told you a while back?    </seg>
<seg id="87"> Do you remember what it was?"    </seg>
<seg id="88"> The person who was told his name is Baker  is less likely to remember the same word  than the person was told his job is a baker.    </seg>
<seg id="89"> Same word, different amount of remembering; that's weird.    </seg>
<seg id="90"> What's going on here?    </seg>
<seg id="91"> Well, the name Baker doesn't actually mean anything to you.    </seg>
<seg id="92"> It is entirely untethered from all of the other memories  floating around in your skull.    </seg>
<seg id="93"> But the common noun "baker" -- we know bakers.    </seg>
<seg id="94"> Bakers wear funny white hats.    </seg>
<seg id="95"> Bakers have flour on their hands.    </seg>
<seg id="96"> Bakers smell good when they come home from work.    </seg>
<seg id="97"> Maybe we even know a baker.    </seg>
<seg id="98"> And when we first hear that word,  we start putting these associational hooks into it,  that make it easier to fish it back out at some later date.    </seg>
<seg id="99"> The entire art of what is going on in these memory contests,  and the entire art of remembering stuff better in everyday life,  is figuring out ways to transform capital B Bakers  into lower-case B bakers --  to take information that is lacking in context,  in significance, in meaning,  and transform it in some way,  so that it becomes meaningful in the light of all the other things    </seg>
<seg id="100"> that you have in your mind.    </seg>
<seg id="101"> One of the more elaborate techniques for doing this  dates back 2,500 years to Ancient Greece.    </seg>
<seg id="102"> It came to be known as the memory palace.    </seg>
<seg id="103"> The story behind its creation goes like this:  There was a poet called Simonides, who was attending a banquet.    </seg>
<seg id="104"> He was actually the hired entertainment,  because back then, if you wanted to throw a really slamming party,  you didn't hire a D.J., you hired a poet.    </seg>
<seg id="105"> And he stands up, delivers his poem from memory, walks out the door,  and at the moment he does, the banquet hall collapses.    </seg>
<seg id="106"> Kills everybody inside.    </seg>
<seg id="107"> It doesn't just kill everybody,  it mangles the bodies beyond all recognition.    </seg>
<seg id="108"> Nobody can say who was inside,  nobody can say where they were sitting.    </seg>
<seg id="109"> The bodies can't be properly buried.    </seg>
<seg id="110"> It's one tragedy compounding another.    </seg>
<seg id="111"> Simonides, standing outside,  the sole survivor amid the wreckage,  closes his eyes and has this realization,  which is that in his mind's eye,  he can see where each of the guests at the banquet had been sitting.    </seg>
<seg id="112"> And he takes the relatives by the hand,  and guides them each to their loved ones amid the wreckage.    </seg>
<seg id="113"> What Simonides figured out at that moment,  is something that I think we all kind of intuitively know,  which is that, as bad as we are at remembering names and phone numbers,  and word-for-word instructions from our colleagues,  we have really exceptional visual and spatial memories.    </seg>
<seg id="114"> If I asked you to recount the first 10 words of the story  that I just told you about Simonides,  chances are you would have a tough time with it.    </seg>
<seg id="115"> But, I would wager that if I asked you to recall  who is sitting on top of a talking tan horse  in your foyer right now,  you would be able to see that.    </seg>
<seg id="116"> The idea behind the memory palace  is to create this imagined edifice in your mind's eye,  and populate it with images of the things that you want to remember --  the crazier, weirder, more bizarre,  funnier, raunchier, stinkier the image is,  the more unforgettable it's likely to be.    </seg>
<seg id="117"> This is advice that goes back 2,000-plus years  to the earliest Latin memory treatises.    </seg>
<seg id="118"> So how does this work?    </seg>
<seg id="119"> Let's say that you've been invited to TED center stage to give a speech,  and you want to do it from memory,  and you want to do it the way that Cicero would have done it,  if he had been invited to TEDxRome 2,000 years ago.    </seg>
<seg id="120"> What you might do  is picture yourself at the front door of your house.    </seg>
<seg id="121"> And you'd come up with some sort of crazy, ridiculous, unforgettable image,  to remind you that the first thing you want to talk about  is this totally bizarre contest.    </seg>
<seg id="122"> And then you'd go inside your house,  and you would see an image of Cookie Monster on top of Mister Ed.    </seg>
<seg id="123"> And that would remind you  that you would want to then introduce your friend Ed Cook.    </seg>
<seg id="124"> And then you'd see an image of Britney Spears  to remind you of this funny anecdote you want to tell.    </seg>
<seg id="125"> And you'd go into your kitchen,  and the fourth topic you were going to talk about  was this strange journey that you went on for a year,  and you'd have some friends to help you remember that.    </seg>
<seg id="126"> This is how Roman orators memorized their speeches --  not word-for-word, which is just going to screw you up,  but topic-for-topic.    </seg>
<seg id="127"> In fact, the phrase "topic sentence" --  that comes from the Greek word "topos,"  which means "place."    </seg>
<seg id="128"> That's a vestige of when people used to think about oratory and rhetoric  in these sorts of spatial terms.    </seg>
<seg id="129"> The phrase "in the first place,"  that's like "in the first place of your memory palace."    </seg>
<seg id="130"> I thought this was just fascinating,  and I got really into it.    </seg>
<seg id="131"> And I went to a few more of these memory contests,  and I had this notion that I might write something longer  about this subculture of competitive memorizers.    </seg>
<seg id="132"> But there was a problem.    </seg>
<seg id="133"> The problem was that a memory contest  is a pathologically boring event.    </seg>
<seg id="134">   Truly, it is like a bunch of people sitting around taking the SATs --  I mean, the most dramatic it gets  is when somebody starts massaging their temples.    </seg>
<seg id="135"> And I'm a journalist, I need something to write about.    </seg>
<seg id="136"> I know that there's incredible stuff happening in these people's minds,  but I don't have access to it.    </seg>
<seg id="137"> And I realized, if I was going to tell this story,  I needed to walk in their shoes a little bit.    </seg>
<seg id="138"> And so I started trying to spend 15 or 20 minutes  every morning, before I sat down with my New York Times,  just trying to remember something.    </seg>
<seg id="139"> Maybe it was a poem,  maybe it was names from an old yearbook that I bought at a flea market.    </seg>
<seg id="140"> And I found that this was shockingly fun.    </seg>
<seg id="141"> I never would have expected that.    </seg>
<seg id="142"> It was fun because this is actually not about training your memory.    </seg>
<seg id="143"> What you're doing, is you're trying to get better and better  at creating, at dreaming up,  these utterly ludicrous, raunchy, hilarious,  and hopefully unforgettable images in your mind's eye.    </seg>
<seg id="144"> And I got pretty into it.    </seg>
<seg id="145"> This is me wearing my standard competitive memorizer's training kit.    </seg>
<seg id="146"> It's a pair of earmuffs  and a set of safety goggles that have been masked over  except for two small pinholes,  because distraction is the competitive memorizer's greatest enemy.    </seg>
<seg id="147"> I ended up coming back to that same contest that I had covered a year earlier,  and I had this notion that I might enter it,  sort of as an experiment in participatory journalism.    </seg>
<seg id="148"> It'd make, I thought, maybe a nice epilogue to all my research.    </seg>
<seg id="149"> Problem was, the experiment went haywire.    </seg>
<seg id="150"> I won the contest --  which really wasn't supposed to happen.    </seg>
<seg id="151">   Now, it is nice to be able to memorize speeches  and phone numbers and shopping lists,  but it's actually kind of beside the point.    </seg>
<seg id="152"> These are just tricks.    </seg>
<seg id="153"> They work because they're based on some pretty basic principles  about how our brains work.    </seg>
<seg id="154"> And you don't have to be building memory palaces  or memorizing packs of playing cards  to benefit from a little bit of insight about how your mind works.    </seg>
<seg id="155"> We often talk about people with great memories  as though it were some sort of an innate gift,  but that is not the case.    </seg>
<seg id="156"> Great memories are learned.    </seg>
<seg id="157"> At the most basic level, we remember when we pay attention.    </seg>
<seg id="158"> We remember when we are deeply engaged.    </seg>
<seg id="159"> We remember when we are able to take a piece of information and experience,  and figure out why it is meaningful to us,  why it is significant, why it's colorful,  when we're able to transform it in some way that makes sense  in the light of all of the other things floating around in our minds,  when we're able to transform Bakers into bakers.    </seg>
<seg id="160"> The memory palace, these memory techniques --  they're just shortcuts.    </seg>
<seg id="161"> In fact, they're not even really shortcuts.    </seg>
<seg id="162"> They work because they make you work.    </seg>
<seg id="163"> They force a kind of depth of processing,  a kind of mindfulness,  that most of us don't normally walk around exercising.    </seg>
<seg id="164"> But there actually are no shortcuts.    </seg>
<seg id="165"> This is how stuff is made memorable.    </seg>
<seg id="166"> And I think if there's one thing that I want to leave you with,  it's what E.P., the amnesic who couldn't even remember he had a memory problem,  left me with,  which is the notion that our lives are the sum of our memories.    </seg>
<seg id="167"> How much are we willing to lose  from our already short lives,  by losing ourselves in our Blackberries, our iPhones,  by not paying attention to the human being across from us  who is talking with us,  by being so lazy that we're not willing to process deeply?    </seg>
<seg id="168"> I learned firsthand  that there are incredible memory capacities  latent in all of us.    </seg>
<seg id="169"> But if you want to live a memorable life,  you have to be the kind of person  who remembers to remember.    </seg>
<seg id="170"> Thank you.    </seg>
