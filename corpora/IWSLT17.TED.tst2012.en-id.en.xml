<title>Ayah Bdeir: Building blocks that blink, beep and teach</title> 
<reviewer></reviewer> 
<translator></translator> 
<seg id="1"> This may sound strange,  but I'm a big fan of the concrete block.    </seg>
<seg id="2"> The first concrete blocks were manufactured in 1868  with a very simple idea:  modules made of cement of a fixed measurement  that fit together.    </seg>
<seg id="3"> Very quickly concrete blocks became  the most-used construction unit in the world.    </seg>
<seg id="4"> They enabled us to to build things that were larger than us,  buildings, bridges,  one brick at a time.    </seg>
<seg id="5"> Essentially concrete blocks had become  the building block of our time.    </seg>
<seg id="6"> Almost a hundred years later in 1947,  LEGO came up with this.    </seg>
<seg id="7"> It was called the Automatic Binding Brick.    </seg>
<seg id="8"> And in a few short years,  LEGO bricks took place in every household.    </seg>
<seg id="9"> It's estimated that over 400 billion bricks have been produced --  or 75 bricks for every person on the planet.    </seg>
<seg id="10"> You don't have to be an engineer  to make beautiful houses, beautiful bridges, beautiful buildings.    </seg>
<seg id="11"> LEGO made it accessible.    </seg>
<seg id="12"> LEGO has essentially taken the concrete block, the building block of the world,  and made it into the building block  of our imagination.    </seg>
<seg id="13"> Meanwhile the exact same year,  at Bell Labs the next revolution was about to be announced,  the next building block.    </seg>
<seg id="14"> The transistor was a small plastic unit  that would take us from a world  of static bricks piled on top of each other  to a world where everything was interactive.    </seg>
<seg id="15"> Like the concrete block,  the transistor allows you to build  much larger, more complex circuits, one brick at a time.    </seg>
<seg id="16"> But there's a main difference:  The transistor was only for experts.    </seg>
<seg id="17"> I personally don't accept this,  that the building block of our time  is reserved for experts,  so I decided to change that.    </seg>
<seg id="18"> Eight years ago when I was at the Media Lab,  I started exploring this idea  of how to put the power of engineers  in the hands of artists and designers.    </seg>
<seg id="19"> A few years ago I started developing littleBits.    </seg>
<seg id="20"> Let me show you how they work.    </seg>
<seg id="21"> LittleBits are electronic modules  with each one specific function.    </seg>
<seg id="22"> They're pre-engineered  to be light, sound,  motors and sensors.    </seg>
<seg id="23"> And the best part about it  is they snap together with magnets.    </seg>
<seg id="24"> So you can't put them the wrong way.    </seg>
<seg id="25"> The bricks are color-coded.    </seg>
<seg id="26"> Green is output, blue is power,  pink is input and orange is wire.    </seg>
<seg id="27"> So all you need to do is snap a blue to a green  and very quickly you can start making larger circuits.    </seg>
<seg id="28"> You put a blue to a green,  you can make light.    </seg>
<seg id="29"> You can put a knob in between  and now you've made a little dimmer.    </seg>
<seg id="30"> Switch out the knob  for a pulse module,  which is here,  and now you've made a little blinker.    </seg>
<seg id="31"> Add this buzzer  for some extra punch  and you've created a noise machine.    </seg>
<seg id="32"> I'm going to stop that.    </seg>
<seg id="33"> So beyond simple play,  littleBits are actually pretty powerful.    </seg>
<seg id="34"> Instead of having to program, to wire, to solder,  littleBits allow you to program  using very simple intuitive gestures.    </seg>
<seg id="35"> So to make this blink faster or slower,  you would just turn this knob  and basically make it pulse faster or slower.    </seg>
<seg id="36"> The idea behind littleBits  is that it's a growing library.    </seg>
<seg id="37"> We want to make every single interaction in the world  into a ready-to-use brick.    </seg>
<seg id="38"> Lights, sounds, solar panels, motors --  everything should be accessible.    </seg>
<seg id="39"> We've been giving littleBits to kids and seeing them play with them.    </seg>
<seg id="40"> And it's been an incredible experience.    </seg>
<seg id="41"> The nicest thing is how they start to understand  the electronics around them from everyday  that they don't learn at schools.    </seg>
<seg id="42"> For example, how a nightlight works,  or why an elevator door stays open,  or how an iPod responds to touch.    </seg>
<seg id="43"> We've also been taking littleBits to design schools.    </seg>
<seg id="44"> So for example, we've had designers  with no experience with electronics whatsoever  start to play with littleBits as a material.    </seg>
<seg id="45"> Here you see, with felt and paper water bottles,  we have Geordie making ...    </seg>
<seg id="46">     A few weeks ago we took littleBits to RISD  and gave them to some designers  with no experience in engineering whatsoever --  just cardboard, wood and paper -- and told them "Make something."    </seg>
<seg id="47"> Here's an example of a project they made,  a motion-activated confetti canon ball.    </seg>
<seg id="48">   But wait, this is actually my favorite project.    </seg>
<seg id="49"> It's a lobster made of playdough  that's afraid of the dark.    </seg>
<seg id="50">   To these non-engineers, littleBits became another material,  electronics became just another material.    </seg>
<seg id="51"> And we want to make this material accessible to everyone.    </seg>
<seg id="52"> So littleBits is open-source.    </seg>
<seg id="53"> You can go on the website, download all the design files, make them yourself.    </seg>
<seg id="54"> We want to encourage a world  of creators, of inventors, of contributors,  because this world that we live in,  this interactive world, is ours.    </seg>
<seg id="55"> So go ahead and start inventing.    </seg>
<seg id="56"> Thank you.    </seg>

<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: The ocean has degraded within our lifetimes, as shown in the decreasing average size of fish. And yet, as Daniel Pauly shows us onstage at Mission Blue, each time the baseline drops, we call it the new "normal." At what point do we stop readjusting downward?</description>

<title>Daniel Pauly: The ocean's shifting baseline</title> 
<reviewer></reviewer> 
<translator></translator> 
<seg id="1"> I'm going to speak  about a tiny, little idea.    </seg>
<seg id="2"> And this is about shifting baseline.    </seg>
<seg id="3"> And because the idea can be explained in one minute,  I will tell you three stories before  to fill in the time.    </seg>
<seg id="4"> And the first story  is about Charles Darwin, one of my heroes.    </seg>
<seg id="5"> And he was here, as you well know, in '35.    </seg>
<seg id="6"> And you'd think he was chasing finches,  but he wasn't.    </seg>
<seg id="7"> He was actually collecting fish.    </seg>
<seg id="8"> And he described one of them  as very "common."    </seg>
<seg id="9"> This was the sailfin grouper.    </seg>
<seg id="10"> A big fishery was run on it  until the '80s.    </seg>
<seg id="11"> Now the fish is on the IUCN Red List.    </seg>
<seg id="12"> Now this story,  we have heard it lots of times  on Galapagos and other places,  so there is nothing particular about it.    </seg>
<seg id="13"> But the point is, we still come to Galapagos.    </seg>
<seg id="14"> We still think it is pristine.    </seg>
<seg id="15"> The brochures still say  it is untouched.    </seg>
<seg id="16"> So what happens here?    </seg>
<seg id="17"> The second story, also to illustrate another concept,  is called shifting waistline.    </seg>
<seg id="18">   Because I was there in '71,  studying a lagoon in West Africa.    </seg>
<seg id="19"> I was there because I grew up in Europe  and I wanted later to work in Africa.    </seg>
<seg id="20"> And I thought I could blend in.    </seg>
<seg id="21"> And I got a big sunburn,  and I was convinced that I was really not from there.    </seg>
<seg id="22"> This was my first sunburn.    </seg>
<seg id="23"> And the lagoon  was surrounded by palm trees,  as you can see, and a few mangrove.    </seg>
<seg id="24"> And it had tilapia  about 20 centimeters,  a species of tilapia called blackchin tilapia.    </seg>
<seg id="25"> And the fisheries for this tilapia  sustained lots of fish and they had a good time  and they earned more than average  in Ghana.    </seg>
<seg id="26"> When I went there 27 years later,  the fish had shrunk to half of their size.    </seg>
<seg id="27"> They were maturing at five centimeters.    </seg>
<seg id="28"> They had been pushed genetically.    </seg>
<seg id="29"> There were still fishes.    </seg>
<seg id="30"> They were still kind of happy.    </seg>
<seg id="31"> And the fish also were happy to be there.    </seg>
<seg id="32"> So nothing has changed,  but everything has changed.    </seg>
<seg id="33"> My third little story  is that I was an accomplice  in the introduction of trawling  in Southeast Asia.    </seg>
<seg id="34"> In the '70s -- well, beginning in the '60s --  Europe did lots of development projects.    </seg>
<seg id="35"> Fish development  meant imposing on countries  that had already 100,000 fishers  to impose on them industrial fishing.    </seg>
<seg id="36"> And this boat, quite ugly,  is called the Mutiara 4.    </seg>
<seg id="37"> And I went sailing on it,  and we did surveys  throughout the southern South China sea  and especially the Java Sea.    </seg>
<seg id="38"> And what we caught,  we didn't have words for it.    </seg>
<seg id="39"> What we caught, I know now,  is the bottom of the sea.    </seg>
<seg id="40"> And 90 percent of our catch  were sponges,  other animals that are fixed on the bottom.    </seg>
<seg id="41"> And actually most of the fish,  they are a little spot on the debris,  the piles of debris, were coral reef fish.    </seg>
<seg id="42"> Essentially the bottom of the sea came onto the deck  and then was thrown down.    </seg>
<seg id="43"> And these pictures are extraordinary  because this transition is very rapid.    </seg>
<seg id="44"> Within a year, you do a survey  and then commercial fishing begins.    </seg>
<seg id="45"> The bottom is transformed  from, in this case, a hard bottom or soft coral  into a muddy mess.    </seg>
<seg id="46"> This is a dead turtle.    </seg>
<seg id="47"> They were not eaten, they were thrown away because they were dead.    </seg>
<seg id="48"> And one time we caught a live one.    </seg>
<seg id="49"> It was not drowned yet.    </seg>
<seg id="50"> And then they wanted to kill it because it was good to eat.    </seg>
<seg id="51"> This mountain of debris  is actually collected by fishers  every time they go  into an area that's never been fished.    </seg>
<seg id="52"> But it's not documented.    </seg>
<seg id="53"> We transform the world,  but we don't remember it.    </seg>
<seg id="54"> We adjust our baseline  to the new level,  and we don't recall what was there.    </seg>
<seg id="55"> If you generalize this,  something like this happens.    </seg>
<seg id="56"> You have on the y axis some good thing:  biodiversity, numbers of orca,  the greenness of your country, the water supply.    </seg>
<seg id="57"> And over time it changes --  it changes  because people do things, or naturally.    </seg>
<seg id="58"> Every generation  will use the images  that they got at the beginning of their conscious lives  as a standard  and will extrapolate forward.    </seg>
<seg id="59"> And the difference then,  they perceive as a loss.    </seg>
<seg id="60"> But they don't perceive what happened before as a loss.    </seg>
<seg id="61"> You can have a succession of changes.    </seg>
<seg id="62"> At the end you want to sustain  miserable leftovers.    </seg>
<seg id="63"> And that, to a large extent, is what we want to do now.    </seg>
<seg id="64"> We want to sustain things that are gone  or things that are not the way they were.    </seg>
<seg id="65"> Now one should think  this problem affected people  certainly when in predatory societies,  they killed animals  and they didn't know they had done so  after a few generations.    </seg>
<seg id="66"> Because, obviously,  an animal that is very abundant,  before it gets extinct,  it becomes rare.    </seg>
<seg id="67"> So you don't lose abundant animals.    </seg>
<seg id="68"> You always lose rare animals.    </seg>
<seg id="69"> And therefore they're not perceived  as a big loss.    </seg>
<seg id="70"> Over time,  we concentrate on large animals,  and in a sea that means the big fish.    </seg>
<seg id="71"> They become rarer because we fish them.    </seg>
<seg id="72"> Over time we have a few fish left  and we think this is the baseline.    </seg>
<seg id="73"> And the question is,  why do people accept this?    </seg>
<seg id="74"> Well because they don't know that it was different.    </seg>
<seg id="75"> And in fact, lots of people, scientists,  will contest that it was really different.    </seg>
<seg id="76"> And they will contest this  because the evidence  presented in an earlier mode  is not in the way  they would like the evidence presented.    </seg>
<seg id="77"> For example,  the anecdote that some present,  as Captain so-and-so  observed lots of fish in this area  cannot be used  or is usually not utilized by fishery scientists,  because it's not "scientific."    </seg>
<seg id="78"> So you have a situation  where people don't know the past,  even though we live in literate societies,  because they don't trust  the sources of the past.    </seg>
<seg id="79"> And hence, the enormous role  that a marine protected area can play.    </seg>
<seg id="80"> Because with marine protected areas,  we actually recreate the past.    </seg>
<seg id="81"> We recreate the past that people cannot conceive  because the baseline has shifted  and is extremely low.    </seg>
<seg id="82"> That is for people  who can see a marine protected area  and who can benefit  from the insight that it provides,  which enables them to reset their baseline.    </seg>
<seg id="83"> How about the people who can't do that  because they have no access --  the people in the Midwest for example?    </seg>
<seg id="84"> There I think  that the arts and film  can perhaps fill the gap,  and simulation.    </seg>
<seg id="85"> This is a simulation of Chesapeake Bay.    </seg>
<seg id="86"> There were gray whales in Chesapeake Bay a long time ago --  500 years ago.    </seg>
<seg id="87"> And you will have noticed that the hues and tones  are like "Avatar."    </seg>
<seg id="88">   And if you think about "Avatar,"  if you think of why people were so touched by it --  never mind the Pocahontas story --  why so touched by the imagery?    </seg>
<seg id="89"> Because it evokes something  that in a sense has been lost.    </seg>
<seg id="90"> And so my recommendation,  it's the only one I will provide,  is for Cameron to do "Avatar II" underwater.    </seg>
<seg id="91"> Thank you very much.    </seg>

<title>Kevin Allocca: Why videos go viral</title> 
<reviewer></reviewer> 
<translator></translator> 
<seg id="1"> Hi. I'm Kevin Allocca, I'm the trends manager at YouTube,  and I professionally watch YouTube videos.    </seg>
<seg id="2"> It's true.    </seg>
<seg id="3"> So we're going to talk a little bit today about how videos go viral  and then why that even matters.    </seg>
<seg id="4"> We all want to be stars --  celebrities, singers, comedians --  and when I was younger, that seemed so very, very hard to do.    </seg>
<seg id="5"> But now Web video has made it  so that any of us or any of the creative things that we do  can become completely famous  in a part of our world's culture.    </seg>
<seg id="6"> Any one of you could be famous on the Internet  by next Saturday.    </seg>
<seg id="7"> But there are over 48 hours of video uploaded to YouTube  every minute.    </seg>
<seg id="8"> And of that, only a tiny percentage  ever goes viral and gets tons of views and becomes a cultural moment.    </seg>
<seg id="9"> So how does it happen?    </seg>
<seg id="10"> Three things:  tastemakers, communities of participation  and unexpectedness.    </seg>
<seg id="11"> All right, let's go.    </seg>
<seg id="12">  Bear Vasquez: Oh, my God. Oh, my God.    </seg>
<seg id="13"> Oh, my God!    </seg>
<seg id="14"> Wooo!    </seg>
<seg id="15"> Ohhhhh, wowwww!    </seg>
<seg id="16"> KA: Last year, Bear Vasquez posted this video  that he had shot outside his home in Yosemite National Park.    </seg>
<seg id="17"> In 2010, it was viewed 23 million times.    </seg>
<seg id="18">   This is a chart of what it looked like  when it first became popular last summer.    </seg>
<seg id="19"> But he didn't actually set out to make a viral video, Bear.    </seg>
<seg id="20"> He just wanted to share a rainbow.    </seg>
<seg id="21"> Because that's what you do when your name is Yosemite Mountain Bear.    </seg>
<seg id="22">   And he had posted lots of nature videos in fact.    </seg>
<seg id="23"> And this video had actually been posted  all the way back in January.    </seg>
<seg id="24"> So what happened here?    </seg>
<seg id="25"> Jimmy Kimmel actually.    </seg>
<seg id="26"> Jimmy Kimmel posted this tweet  that would eventually propel the video to be as popular as it would become.    </seg>
<seg id="27"> Because tastemakers like Jimmy Kimmel  introduce us to new and interesting things  and bring them to a larger audience.    </seg>
<seg id="28">  Rebecca Black: ♫ It's Friday, Friday. Gotta get down on Friday. ♫  ♫ Everybody's looking forward to the weekend, weekend. ♫  ♫ Friday, Friday. Gettin' down on Friday. ♫  KA: So you didn't think that we could actually have this conversation  without talking about this video I hope.    </seg>
<seg id="29"> Rebecca Black's "Friday" is one of the most popular videos of the year.    </seg>
<seg id="30"> It's been seen nearly 200 million times this year.    </seg>
<seg id="31"> This is a chart of what it looked like.    </seg>
<seg id="32"> And similar to "Double Rainbow,"  it seems to have just sprouted up out of nowhere.    </seg>
<seg id="33"> So what happened on this day?    </seg>
<seg id="34"> Well it was a Friday, this is true.    </seg>
<seg id="35"> And if you're wondering about those other spikes, those are also Fridays.    </seg>
<seg id="36">   But what about this day,  this one particular Friday?    </seg>
<seg id="37"> Well Tosh.0 picked it up, a lot of blogs starting writing about.    </seg>
<seg id="38"> Michael J. Nelson from Mystery Science Theater  was one of the first people to post a joke about the video on Twitter.    </seg>
<seg id="39"> But what's important is that an individual or a group of tastemakers  took a point of view  and they shared that with a larger audience, accelerating the process.    </seg>
<seg id="40"> And so then this community formed  of people who shared this big inside joke  and they started talking about it and doing things with it.    </seg>
<seg id="41"> And now there are 10,000 parodies of "Friday" on YouTube.    </seg>
<seg id="42"> Even in the first seven days,  there was one parody for every other day of the week.    </seg>
<seg id="43">   Unlike the one-way entertainment of the 20th century,  this community participation  is how we become a part of the phenomenon --  either by spreading it or by doing something new with it.    </seg>
<seg id="44">   So "Nyan Cat" is a looped animation  with looped music.    </seg>
<seg id="45"> It's this, just like this.    </seg>
<seg id="46"> It's been viewed nearly 50 million times this year.    </seg>
<seg id="47"> And if you think that that is weird,  you should know that there is a three-hour version of this  that's been viewed four million times.    </seg>
<seg id="48">   Even cats were watching this video.    </seg>
<seg id="49">   Cats were watching other cats watch this video.    </seg>
<seg id="50">   But what's important here  is the creativity that it inspired  amongst this techie, geeky Internet culture.    </seg>
<seg id="51"> There were remixes.    </seg>
<seg id="52">   Someone made an old timey version.    </seg>
<seg id="53">   And then it went international.    </seg>
<seg id="54">   An entire remix community sprouted up  that brought it from being just a stupid joke  to something that we can all actually be a part of.    </seg>
<seg id="55"> Because we don't just enjoy now,  we participate.    </seg>
<seg id="56"> And who could have predicted any of this?    </seg>
<seg id="57"> Who could have predicted "Double Rainbow" or Rebecca Black  or "Nyan Cat?"    </seg>
<seg id="58"> What scripts could you have written  that would have contained this in it?    </seg>
<seg id="59"> In a world where over two days of video  get uploaded every minute,  only that which is truly unique and unexpected  can stand out in the way that these things have.    </seg>
<seg id="60"> When a friend of mine told me that I needed to see this great video  about a guy protesting bicycle fines in New York City,  I admit I wasn't very interested.    </seg>
<seg id="61">  Casey Niestat: So I got a ticket for not riding in the bike lane,  but often there are obstructions  that keep you from properly riding in the bike lane.    </seg>
<seg id="62">   KA: By being totally surprising and humorous,  Casey Niestat got his funny idea and point  seen five million times.    </seg>
<seg id="63"> And so this approach holds  for anything new that we do creatively.    </seg>
<seg id="64"> And so it all brings us  to one big question ...    </seg>
<seg id="65">  Bear Vasquez: What does this mean?    </seg>
<seg id="66"> Ohhhh.    </seg>

<seg id="68"> Tastemakers, creative participating communities,  complete unexpectedness,  these are characteristics of a new kind of media and a new kind of culture  where anyone has access  and the audience defines the popularity.    </seg>

<seg id="1"> How can I speak in 10 minutes  about the bonds of women over three generations,  about how the astonishing strength of those bonds  took hold in the life  of a four-year-old girl  huddled with her young sister,  her mother and her grandmother  for five days and nights  in a small boat in the China Sea  more than 30 years ago,  bonds that took hold in the life of that small girl    </seg>
<seg id="2"> and never let go --  that small girl now living in San Francisco  and speaking to you today?    </seg>
<seg id="3"> This is not a finished story.    </seg>
<seg id="4"> It is a jigsaw puzzle still being put together.    </seg>
<seg id="5"> Let me tell you about some of the pieces.    </seg>
<seg id="6"> Imagine the first piece:  a man burning his life's work.    </seg>
<seg id="7"> He is a poet, a playwright,  a man whose whole life  had been balanced on the single hope  of his country's unity and freedom.    </seg>
<seg id="8"> Imagine him as the communists enter Saigon,  confronting the fact  that his life had been a complete waste.    </seg>
<seg id="9"> Words, for so long his friends, now mocked him.    </seg>
<seg id="10"> He retreated into silence.    </seg>
<seg id="11"> He died broken by history.    </seg>
<seg id="12"> He is my grandfather.    </seg>
<seg id="13"> I never knew him in real life.    </seg>
<seg id="14"> But our lives are much more than our memories.    </seg>
<seg id="15"> My grandmother never let me forget his life.    </seg>
<seg id="16"> My duty was not to allow it to have been in vain,  and my lesson was to learn  that, yes, history tried to crush us,  but we endured.    </seg>
<seg id="17"> The next piece of the jigsaw  is of a boat in the early dawn  slipping silently out to sea.    </seg>
<seg id="18"> My mother, Mai, was 18  when her father died --  already in an arranged marriage,  already with two small girls.    </seg>
<seg id="19"> For her, life had distilled itself into one task:  the escape of her family  and a new life in Australia.    </seg>
<seg id="20"> It was inconceivable to her  that she would not succeed.    </seg>
<seg id="21"> So after a four-year saga that defies fiction,  a boat slipped out to sea  disguised as a fishing vessel.    </seg>
<seg id="22"> All the adults knew the risks.    </seg>
<seg id="23"> The greatest fear was of pirates,  rape and death.    </seg>
<seg id="24"> Like most adults on the boat,  my mother carried a small bottle of poison.    </seg>
<seg id="25"> If we were captured, first my sister and I,  then she and my grandmother would drink.    </seg>
<seg id="26"> My first memories are from the boat --  the steady beat of the engine,  the bow dipping into each wave,  the vast and empty horizon.    </seg>
<seg id="27"> I don't remember the pirates who came many times,  but were bluffed by the bravado  of the men on our boat,  or the engine dying  and failing to start for six hours.    </seg>
<seg id="28"> But I do remember the lights on the oil rig  off the Malaysian coast  and the young man who collapsed and died,  the journey's end too much for him,  and the first apple I tasted,  given to me by the men on the rig.    </seg>
<seg id="29"> No apple has ever tasted the same.    </seg>
<seg id="30"> After three months in a refugee camp,  we landed in Melbourne.    </seg>
<seg id="31"> And the next piece of the jigsaw  is about four women across three generations  shaping a new life together.    </seg>
<seg id="32"> We settled in Footscray,  a working-class suburb  whose demographic is layers of immigrants.    </seg>
<seg id="33"> Unlike the settled middle-class suburbs,  whose existence I was oblivious of,  there was no sense of entitlement in Footscray.    </seg>
<seg id="34"> The smells from shop doors were from the rest of the world.    </seg>
<seg id="35"> And the snippets of halting English  were exchanged between people  who had one thing in common,  they were starting again.    </seg>
<seg id="36"> My mother worked on farms,  then on a car assembly line,  working six days, double shifts.    </seg>
<seg id="37"> Somehow she found time to study English  and gain IT qualifications.    </seg>
<seg id="38"> We were poor.    </seg>
<seg id="39"> All the dollars were allocated  and extra tuition in English and mathematics  was budgeted for  regardless of what missed out,  which was usually new clothes;  they were always secondhand.    </seg>
<seg id="40"> Two pairs of stockings for school,  each to hide the holes in the other.    </seg>
<seg id="41"> A school uniform down to the ankles,  because it had to last for six years.    </seg>
<seg id="42"> And there were rare but searing chants  of "slit-eye"  and the occasional graffiti:  "Asian, go home."    </seg>
<seg id="43"> Go home to where?    </seg>
<seg id="44"> Something stiffened inside me.    </seg>
<seg id="45"> There was a gathering of resolve  and a quiet voice saying, "I will bypass you."    </seg>
<seg id="46"> My mother, my sister and I  slept in the same bed.    </seg>
<seg id="47"> My mother was exhausted each night,  but we told one another about our day  and listened to the movements  of my grandmother around the house.    </seg>
<seg id="48"> My mother suffered from nightmares  all about the boat.    </seg>
<seg id="49"> And my job was to stay awake until her nightmares came  so I could wake her.    </seg>
<seg id="50"> She opened a computer store  then studied to be a beautician  and opened another business.    </seg>
<seg id="51"> And the women came with their stories  about men who could not make the transition,  angry and inflexible,  and troubled children caught between two worlds.    </seg>
<seg id="52"> Grants and sponsors were sought.    </seg>
<seg id="53"> Centers were established.    </seg>
<seg id="54"> I lived in parallel worlds.    </seg>
<seg id="55"> In one, I was the classic Asian student,  relentless in the demands that I made on myself.    </seg>
<seg id="56"> In the other, I was enmeshed in lives that were precarious,  tragically scarred by violence,  drug abuse and isolation.    </seg>
<seg id="57"> But so many over the years were helped.    </seg>
<seg id="58"> And for that work, when I was a final year law student,  I was chosen as the young Australian of the year.    </seg>
<seg id="59"> And I was catapulted  from one piece of the jigsaw to another,  and their edges didn't fit.    </seg>
<seg id="60"> Tan Le, anonymous Footscray resident,  was now Tan Le, refugee and social activist,  invited to speak in venues she had never heard of  and into homes whose existence  she could never have imagined.    </seg>
<seg id="61"> I didn't know the protocols.    </seg>
<seg id="62"> I didn't know how to use the cutlery.    </seg>
<seg id="63"> I didn't know how to talk about wine.    </seg>
<seg id="64"> I didn't know how to talk about anything.    </seg>
<seg id="65"> I wanted to retreat to the routines and comfort  of life in an unsung suburb --  a grandmother, a mother and two daughters  ending each day as they had for almost 20 years,  telling one another the story of their day  and falling asleep,  the three of us still in the same bed.    </seg>
<seg id="66"> I told my mother I couldn't do it.    </seg>
<seg id="67"> She reminded me that I was now the same age she had been  when we boarded the boat.    </seg>
<seg id="68"> No had never been an option.    </seg>
<seg id="69"> "Just do it," she said,  "and don't be what you're not."    </seg>
<seg id="70"> So I spoke out on youth unemployment and education  and the neglect of the marginalized and the disenfranchised.    </seg>
<seg id="71"> And the more candidly I spoke,  the more I was asked to speak.    </seg>
<seg id="72"> I met people from all walks of life,  so many of them doing the thing they loved,  living on the frontiers of possibility.    </seg>
<seg id="73"> And even though I finished my degree,  I realized I could not settle into a career in law.    </seg>
<seg id="74"> There had to be another piece of the jigsaw.    </seg>
<seg id="75"> And I realized at the same time  that it is okay to be an outsider,  a recent arrival,  new on the scene --  and not just okay,  but something to be thankful for,  perhaps a gift from the boat.    </seg>
<seg id="76"> Because being an insider  can so easily mean collapsing the horizons,  can so easily mean  accepting the presumptions of your province.    </seg>
<seg id="77"> I have stepped outside my comfort zone enough now  to know that, yes, the world does fall apart,  but not in the way that you fear.    </seg>
<seg id="78"> Possibilities that would not have been allowed  were outrageously encouraged.    </seg>
<seg id="79"> There was an energy there,  an implacable optimism,  a strange mixture of humility and daring.    </seg>
<seg id="80"> So I followed my hunches.    </seg>
<seg id="81"> I gathered around me a small team of people  for whom the label "It can't be done"  was an irresistible challenge.    </seg>
<seg id="82"> For a year we were penniless.    </seg>
<seg id="83"> At the end of each day, I made a huge pot of soup  which we all shared.    </seg>
<seg id="84"> We worked well into each night.    </seg>
<seg id="85"> Most of our ideas were crazy,  but a few were brilliant,  and we broke through.    </seg>
<seg id="86"> I made the decision to move to the U.S.    </seg>
<seg id="87"> after only one trip.    </seg>
<seg id="88"> My hunches again.    </seg>
<seg id="89"> Three months later I had relocated,  and the adventure has continued.    </seg>
<seg id="90"> Before I close though,  let me tell you about my grandmother.    </seg>
<seg id="91"> She grew up at a time  when Confucianism was the social norm  and the local Mandarin was the person who mattered.    </seg>
<seg id="92"> Life hadn't changed for centuries.    </seg>
<seg id="93"> Her father died soon after she was born.    </seg>
<seg id="94"> Her mother raised her alone.    </seg>
<seg id="95"> At 17 she became the second wife  of a Mandarin whose mother beat her.    </seg>
<seg id="96"> With no support from her husband,  she caused a sensation by taking him to court  and prosecuting her own case,  and a far greater sensation when she won.    </seg>
<seg id="97">     "It can't be done" was shown to be wrong.    </seg>
<seg id="98"> I was taking a shower in a hotel room in Sydney  the moment she died  600 miles away in Melbourne.    </seg>
<seg id="99"> I looked through the shower screen  and saw her standing on the other side.    </seg>
<seg id="100"> I knew she had come to say goodbye.    </seg>
<seg id="101"> My mother phoned minutes later.    </seg>
<seg id="102"> A few days later,  we went to a Buddhist temple in Footscray  and sat around her casket.    </seg>
<seg id="103"> We told her stories  and assured her that we were still with her.    </seg>
<seg id="104"> At midnight the monk came  and told us he had to close the casket.    </seg>
<seg id="105"> My mother asked us to feel her hand.    </seg>
<seg id="106"> She asked the monk,  "Why is it that her hand is so warm  and the rest of her is so cold?"    </seg>
<seg id="107"> "Because you have been holding it since this morning," he said.    </seg>
<seg id="108"> "You have not let it go."    </seg>
<seg id="109"> If there is a sinew in our family,  it runs through the women.    </seg>
<seg id="110"> Given who we were and how life had shaped us,  we can now see  that the men who might have come into our lives  would have thwarted us.    </seg>
<seg id="111"> Defeat would have come too easily.    </seg>
<seg id="112"> Now I would like to have my own children,  and I wonder about the boat.    </seg>
<seg id="113"> Who could ever wish it on their own?    </seg>
<seg id="114"> Yet I am afraid of privilege,  of ease,  of entitlement.    </seg>
<seg id="115"> Can I give them a bow in their lives,  dipping bravely into each wave,  the unperturbed and steady beat of the engine,  the vast horizon  that guarantees nothing?    </seg>
<seg id="116"> I don't know.    </seg>
<seg id="117"> But if I could give it  and still see them safely through,  I would.    </seg>

<title>Shilo Shiv Suleman: Using tech to enable dreaming</title> 
<reviewer></reviewer> 
<translator></translator> 
<seg id="1"> My story begins right here actually in Rajasthan  about two years ago.    </seg>
<seg id="2"> I was in the desert, under the starry skies  with the Sufi singer Mukhtiar Ali.    </seg>
<seg id="3"> And we were in conversation  about how nothing had changed  since the time of the ancient Indian epic "The Mahabharata."    </seg>
<seg id="4"> So back in the day, when us Indians wanted to travel  we'd jump into a chariot and we'd zoom across the sky.    </seg>
<seg id="5"> Now we do the same with airplanes.    </seg>
<seg id="6"> Back then,  when Arjuna, the great Indian warrior prince,  when he was thirsty, he'd take out a bow,  he'd shoot it into the ground and water would come out.    </seg>
<seg id="7"> Now we do the same  with drills and machines.    </seg>
<seg id="8"> The conclusion that we came to  was that magic had been replaced  by machinery.    </seg>
<seg id="9"> And this made me really sad.    </seg>
<seg id="10"> I found myself becoming a little bit of a technophobe.    </seg>
<seg id="11"> I was terrified by this idea  that I would lose the ability  to enjoy and appreciate the sunset  without having my camera on me, without tweeting it to my friends.    </seg>
<seg id="12"> And it felt like technology  should enable magic, not kill it.    </seg>
<seg id="13"> When I was a little girl,  my grandfather gave me his little silver pocket watch.    </seg>
<seg id="14"> And this piece of 50-year-old technology  became the most magical thing to me.    </seg>
<seg id="15"> It became a gilded gateway  into a world full of pirates and shipwrecks  and images in my imagination.    </seg>
<seg id="16"> So I felt like our cellphones  and our fancy watches and our cameras  had stopped us from dreaming.    </seg>
<seg id="17"> They stopped us from being inspired.    </seg>
<seg id="18"> And so I jumped in, I jumped into this world of technology,  to see how I could use it to enable magic  as opposed to kill it.    </seg>
<seg id="19"> I've been illustrating books since I was 16.    </seg>
<seg id="20"> And so when I saw the iPad,  I saw it as a storytelling device  that could connect readers all over the world.    </seg>
<seg id="21"> It can know how we're holding it.    </seg>
<seg id="22"> It can know where we are.    </seg>
<seg id="23"> It brings together image and text  and animation and sound and touch.    </seg>
<seg id="24"> Storytelling is becoming  more and more multi-sensorial.    </seg>
<seg id="25"> But what are we doing with it?    </seg>
<seg id="26"> So I'm actually just going to go in and launch Khoya,  an interactive app for the iPad.    </seg>
<seg id="27"> So it says, "Place your fingers  upon each light."    </seg>
<seg id="28"> And so --    It says, "This box belongs to ... "  And so I type in my name.    </seg>
<seg id="29"> And actually I become a character in the book.    </seg>
<seg id="30"> At various points, a little letter drops down to me --  and the iPad knows where you live because of GPS --  which is actually addressed to me.    </seg>
<seg id="31"> The child in me is really excited  by these kinds of possibilities.    </seg>
<seg id="32"> Now I've been talking a lot about magic.    </seg>
<seg id="33"> And I don't mean wizards and dragons,  I mean the kind of childhood magic,  those ideas that we all harbored as children.    </seg>
<seg id="34"> This idea of fireflies in a jar, for some reason,  was always really exciting to me.    </seg>
<seg id="35"> And so over here you need to tilt your iPad,  take the fireflies out.    </seg>
<seg id="36"> And they actually illuminate your way through the rest of the book.    </seg>
<seg id="37"> Another idea that really fascinated me as a child  was that an entire galaxy could be contained  within a single marble.    </seg>
<seg id="38"> And so over here,  each book and each world  becomes a little marble  that I drag in  to this magical device within the device.    </seg>
<seg id="39"> And it opens up a map.    </seg>
<seg id="40"> All along, all fantasy books have always had maps,  but these maps have been static.    </seg>
<seg id="41"> This is a map that grows and glows  and becomes your navigation for the rest of the book.    </seg>
<seg id="42"> It reveals itself to you at certain points in the book as well.    </seg>
<seg id="43"> So I'm just going to enter in.    </seg>
<seg id="44"> Another thing that's actually really important to me  is creating content that is Indian  and yet very contemporary.    </seg>
<seg id="45"> Over here, these are the Apsaras.    </seg>
<seg id="46"> So we've all heard about fairies and we've all heard about nymphs,  but how many people outside of India  know about their Indian counterparts, the Apsaras?    </seg>
<seg id="47"> These poor Apsaras have been trapped inside Indra's chambers for thousands of years  in an old and musty book.    </seg>
<seg id="48"> And so we're bringing them back  in a contemporary story for children.    </seg>
<seg id="49"> And a story that actually deals with new issues  like the environmental crisis.    </seg>
<seg id="50">   Speaking of the environmental crisis,  I think a big problem has been in the last 10 years  is that children have been locked inside their rooms,  glued to their PCs, they haven't been able to get out.    </seg>
<seg id="51"> But now with mobile technology,  we can actually take our children outside into the natural world  with their technology.    </seg>
<seg id="52"> One of the interactions in the book  is that you're sent off on this quest  where you need to go outside,  take out your camera on the iPad  and collect pictures of different natural objects.    </seg>
<seg id="53"> When I was a child, I had multiple collections  of sticks and stones and pebbles and shells.    </seg>
<seg id="54"> And somehow kids don't do that anymore.    </seg>
<seg id="55"> So in bringing back this childhood ritual,  you need to go out  and, in one chapter, take a picture of a flower  and then tag it.    </seg>
<seg id="56"> In another chapter, you need to take a picture of a piece of bark  and then tag that.    </seg>
<seg id="57"> And what happens  is that you actually create a digital collection of photographs  that you can then put up online.    </seg>
<seg id="58"> A child in London puts up a picture of a fox  and says, "Oh, I saw a fox today."    </seg>
<seg id="59"> A child in India says, "I saw a monkey today."    </seg>
<seg id="60"> And it creates this kind of social network  around a collection of digital photographs  that you've actually taken.    </seg>
<seg id="61"> In the possibilities of linking together  magic, the earth and technology,  there are multiple possibilities.    </seg>
<seg id="62"> In the next book, we plan on having an interaction  where you take your iPad out with the video on  and through augmented reality,  you see this layer of animated pixies  appear on a houseplant that's outside your house.    </seg>
<seg id="63"> At one point, your screen is filled up with leaves.    </seg>
<seg id="64"> And so you need to make the sound of wind and blow them away  and read the rest of the book.    </seg>
<seg id="65"> We're moving, we're all moving here,  to a world where the forces of nature  come closer together to technology,  and magic and technology can come closer together.    </seg>
<seg id="66"> We're harnessing energy from the sun.    </seg>
<seg id="67"> We're bringing our children and ourselves  closer to the natural world  and that magic and joy  and childhood love that we had  through the simple medium of a story.    </seg>
<seg id="68"> Thank you.    </seg>

<title>Lucien Engelen: Crowdsource your health</title> 
<reviewer></reviewer> 
<translator></translator> 
<seg id="1"> I would like to talk to you  about why many e-health projects fail.    </seg>
<seg id="2"> And I really think that the most important thing of it  is that we stopped listening to patients.    </seg>
<seg id="3"> And one of the things we did at Radboud University  is we appointed a chief listening officer.    </seg>
<seg id="4"> Not in a very scientific way --  she puts up a little cup of coffee or cup of tea  and asks patients, family, relatives,  "What's up?    </seg>
<seg id="5"> How could we help you?"    </seg>
<seg id="6"> And we think, we like to think,  that this is one of the major problems  why all -- maybe not all --  but most of the e-health projects fail,  since we stopped listening.    </seg>
<seg id="7"> This is my WiFi scale. It's a very simple thing.    </seg>
<seg id="8"> It's got one knob, on/off.    </seg>
<seg id="9"> And every morning I hop on it.    </seg>
<seg id="10"> And yes, I've got a challenge,  as you might see.    </seg>
<seg id="11"> And I put my challenge on 95 kg.    </seg>
<seg id="12"> But the thing is that it's made this simple  that whenever I hop on,  it sends my data through Google Health as well.    </seg>
<seg id="13"> And it's collected by my general practitioner as well,  so he can see what's my problem in weight,  not on the very moment  that I need cardiologic support or something like it,  but also looking backward.    </seg>
<seg id="14"> But there's another thing.    </seg>
<seg id="15"> As some of you might know, I've got more than 4,000 followers on Twitter.    </seg>
<seg id="16"> So every morning  I hop on my WiFi scale  and before I'm in my car, people start talking to me,  "I think you need a light lunch today, Lucien."    </seg>
<seg id="17">   But that's the nicest thing that could happen,  since this is peer pressure,  peer pressure used to help patients --  since this could be used for obesity,  it could be used  to stop smoking in patients.    </seg>
<seg id="18"> But on the other hand, it also could be used  to get people from out of their chairs  and try to work together in some kind of gaming activity  to get more control of their health.    </seg>
<seg id="19"> As of next week, it will soon be available.    </seg>
<seg id="20"> There will be this little blood pressure meter  connected to an iPhone or something or other.    </seg>
<seg id="21"> And people will be able, from their homes,  to take their blood pressure,  send it into their doctor  and eventually share it with others, for instance,  for over a hundred dollars.    </seg>
<seg id="22"> And this is the point where patients get into position  and can collect, not only their own control again,  be captain of their own ship,  but also can help us in health care  due to the challenges that we face,  like health care cost explosion,  doubled demand and things like that.    </seg>
<seg id="23"> Make techniques that are easy to use  and start with this to embrace patients in the team.    </seg>
<seg id="24"> And you can do this with techniques like this,  but also by crowd-sourcing.    </seg>
<seg id="25"> And one of the things we did  I would like to share with you introduced by a little video.    </seg>
<seg id="26">   We've all got navigation controls in our car.    </seg>
<seg id="27"> We maybe even [have] it in our cellphone.    </seg>
<seg id="28"> We know perfectly where all the ATMs are  about the city of Maastricht.    </seg>
<seg id="29"> The other thing is we know where all the gas stations are.    </seg>
<seg id="30"> And sure, we could find fast food chains.    </seg>
<seg id="31"> But where would be the nearest AED  to help this patient?    </seg>
<seg id="32"> We asked around and nobody knew.    </seg>
<seg id="33"> Nobody knew where the nearest life-saving AED  was to be obtained right now.    </seg>
<seg id="34"> So what we did, we crowdsourced The Netherlands.    </seg>
<seg id="35"> We set up a website  and asked the crowd, "If you see an AED,  please submit it, tell us where it is,  tell us when it's open,"  since sometimes in office hours sometimes it's closed, of course.    </seg>
<seg id="36"> And over 10,000 AEDs already in The Netherlands  already have been submitted.    </seg>
<seg id="37"> The next step we took was to find the applications for it.    </seg>
<seg id="38"> And we built an iPad application.    </seg>
<seg id="39"> We made an application for Layar, augmented reality,  to find these AEDs.    </seg>
<seg id="40"> And whenever you are in a city like Maastricht and somebody collapses,  you can use your iPhone,  and within the next weeks also run your Microsoft cellphone,  to find the nearest AED  which can save lives.    </seg>
<seg id="41"> And as of today,  we would like to introduce this, not only as AED4EU,  which is what the product is called,  but also AED4US.    </seg>
<seg id="42"> And we would like to start this on a worldwide level.    </seg>
<seg id="43"> And [we're] asking all of our colleagues in the rest of the world,  colleague universities, to help us  to find and work and act like a hub  to crowd-source all these AEDs all around the world.    </seg>
<seg id="44"> That whenever you're on holiday and somebody collapses,  might it be your own relative or someone just in front of you,  you can find this.    </seg>
<seg id="45"> The other thing we would like to ask  is of companies also all over the world  that will be able to help us validate these AEDs.    </seg>
<seg id="46"> These might be courier services  or cable guys for instance,  just to see whether the AED that's submitted  still is in place.    </seg>
<seg id="47"> So please help us on this one  and try to make not only health a little bit better, but take control of it.    </seg>
<seg id="48"> Thank you.    </seg>

<title>Erik Johansson: Impossible photography</title> 
<reviewer></reviewer> 
<translator></translator> 
<seg id="1"> I'm here to share my photography.    </seg>
<seg id="2"> Or is it photography?    </seg>
<seg id="3"> Because, of course, this is a photograph  that you can't take with your camera.    </seg>
<seg id="4"> Yet, my interest in photography started  as I got my first digital camera  at the age of 15.    </seg>
<seg id="5"> It mixed with my earlier passion for drawing,  but it was a bit different,  because using the camera,  the process was in the planning instead.    </seg>
<seg id="6"> And when you take a photograph with a camera,  the process ends when you press the trigger.    </seg>
<seg id="7"> So to me it felt like photography was more about  being at the right place and the right time.    </seg>
<seg id="8"> I felt like anyone could do that.    </seg>
<seg id="9"> So I wanted to create something different,  something where the process starts  when you press the trigger.    </seg>
<seg id="10"> Photos like this:  construction going on along a busy road.    </seg>
<seg id="11"> But it has an unexpected twist.    </seg>
<seg id="12"> And despite that,  it retains a level of realism.    </seg>
<seg id="13"> Or photos like these --  both dark and colorful,  but all with a common goal  of retaining the level of realism.    </seg>
<seg id="14"> When I say realism,  I mean photo-realism.    </seg>
<seg id="15"> Because, of course,  it's not something you can capture really,  but I always want it to look like it could have been captured somehow  as a photograph.    </seg>
<seg id="16"> Photos where you will need a brief moment to think  to figure out the trick.    </seg>
<seg id="17"> So it's more about capturing an idea  than about capturing a moment really.    </seg>
<seg id="18"> But what's the trick  that makes it look realistic?    </seg>
<seg id="19"> Is it something about the details  or the colors?    </seg>
<seg id="20"> Is it something about the light?    </seg>
<seg id="21"> What creates the illusion?    </seg>
<seg id="22"> Sometimes the perspective is the illusion.    </seg>
<seg id="23"> But in the end, it comes down to how we interpret the world  and how it can be realized on a two-dimensional surface.    </seg>
<seg id="24"> It's not really what is realistic,  it's what we think looks realistic really.    </seg>
<seg id="25"> So I think the basics  are quite simple.    </seg>
<seg id="26"> I just see it as a puzzle of reality  where you can take different pieces of reality and put it together  to create alternate reality.    </seg>
<seg id="27"> And let me show you a simple example.    </seg>
<seg id="28"> Here we have three perfectly imaginable physical objects,  something we all can relate to living in a three-dimensional world.    </seg>
<seg id="29"> But combined in a certain way,  they can create something that still looks three-dimensional,  like it could exist.    </seg>
<seg id="30"> But at the same time, we know it can't.    </seg>
<seg id="31"> So we trick our brains,  because our brain simply doesn't accept the fact  that it doesn't really make sense.    </seg>
<seg id="32"> And I see the same process  with combining photographs.    </seg>
<seg id="33"> It's just really about combining different realities.    </seg>
<seg id="34"> So the things that make a photograph look realistic,  I think it's the things that we don't even think about,  the things all around us in our daily lives.    </seg>
<seg id="35"> But when combining photographs,  this is really important to consider,  because otherwise it just looks wrong somehow.    </seg>
<seg id="36"> So I would like to say that there are three simple rules to follow  to achieve a realistic result.    </seg>
<seg id="37"> As you can see, these images aren't really special.    </seg>
<seg id="38"> But combined, they can create something like this.    </seg>
<seg id="39"> So the first rule is that photos combined  should have the same perspective.    </seg>
<seg id="40"> Secondly, photos combined  should have the same type of light.    </seg>
<seg id="41"> And these two images both fulfill these two requirements --  shot at the same height and in the same type of light.    </seg>
<seg id="42"> The third one is about making it impossible to distinguish  where the different images begin and end  by making it seamless.    </seg>
<seg id="43"> Make it impossible to say  how the image actually was composed.    </seg>
<seg id="44"> So by matching color, contrast and brightness  in the borders between the different images,  adding photographic defects  like depth of field,  desaturated colors and noise,  we erase the borders between the different images  and make it look like one single image,  despite the fact that one image  can contain hundreds of layers basically.    </seg>
<seg id="45"> So here's another example.    </seg>
<seg id="46">   One might think that this is just an image of a landscape  and the lower part is what's manipulated.    </seg>
<seg id="47"> But this image is actually entirely composed  of photographs from different locations.    </seg>
<seg id="48"> I personally think that it's easier to actually create a place  than to find a place,  because then you don't need to compromise  with the ideas in your head.    </seg>
<seg id="49"> But it does require a lot of planning.    </seg>
<seg id="50"> And getting this idea during winter,  I knew that I had several months to plan it,  to find the different locations  for the pieces of the puzzle basically.    </seg>
<seg id="51"> So for example,  the fish was captured on a fishing trip.    </seg>
<seg id="52"> The shores are from a different location.    </seg>
<seg id="53"> The underwater part was captured in a stone pit.    </seg>
<seg id="54"> And yeah, I even turned the house on top of the island red  to make it look more Swedish.    </seg>
<seg id="55"> So to achieve a realistic result,  I think it comes down to planning.    </seg>
<seg id="56"> It always starts with a sketch, an idea.    </seg>
<seg id="57"> Then it's about combining the different photographs.    </seg>
<seg id="58"> And here every piece is very well planned.    </seg>
<seg id="59"> And if you do a good job capturing the photos,  the result can be quite beautiful  and also quite realistic.    </seg>
<seg id="60"> So all the tools are out there,  and the only thing that limits us  is our imagination.    </seg>
<seg id="61"> Thank you.    </seg>

<title>Sheena Iyengar: How to make choosing easier</title> 
<reviewer></reviewer> 
<translator></translator> 
<seg id="1"> Do you know how many choices you make  in a typical day?    </seg>
<seg id="2"> Do you know how many choices you make  in typical week?    </seg>
<seg id="3"> I recently did a survey  with over 2,000 Americans,  and the average number of choices  that the typical American reports making  is about 70 in a typical day.    </seg>
<seg id="4"> There was also recently a study done with CEOs  in which they followed CEOs around for a whole week.    </seg>
<seg id="5"> And these scientists simply documented all the various tasks  that these CEOs engaged in  and how much time they spent engaging  in making decisions related to these tasks.    </seg>
<seg id="6"> And they found that the average CEO  engaged in about 139 tasks in a week.    </seg>
<seg id="7"> Each task was made up of many, many, many sub-choices of course.    </seg>
<seg id="8"> 50 percent of their decisions  were made in nine minutes or less.    </seg>
<seg id="9"> Only about 12 percent of the decisions  did they make an hour or more of their time.    </seg>
<seg id="10"> Think about your own choices.    </seg>
<seg id="11"> Do you know how many choices  make it into your nine minute category  versus your one hour category?    </seg>
<seg id="12"> How well do you think you're doing  at managing those choices?    </seg>
<seg id="13"> Today I want to talk  about one of the biggest modern day choosing problems that we have,  which is the choice overload problem.    </seg>
<seg id="14"> I want to talk about the problem  and some potential solutions.    </seg>
<seg id="15"> Now as I talk about this problem,  I'm going to have some questions for you  and I'm going to want to know your answers.    </seg>
<seg id="16"> So when I ask you a question,  since I'm blind,  only raise your hand if you want to burn off some calories.    </seg>
<seg id="17">   Otherwise, when I ask you a question,  and if your answer is yes,  I'd like you to clap your hands.    </seg>
<seg id="18"> So for my first question for you today:  Are you guys ready to hear about the choice overload problem?    </seg>
<seg id="19">   Thank you.    </seg>
<seg id="20"> So when I was a graduate student at Stanford University,  I used to go to this very, very upscale grocery store;  at least at that time it was truly upscale.    </seg>
<seg id="21"> It was a store called Draeger's.    </seg>
<seg id="22"> Now this store, it was almost like going to an amusement park.    </seg>
<seg id="23"> They had 250 different kinds of mustards and vinegars  and over 500 different kinds  of fruits and vegetables  and more than two dozen different kinds of bottled water --  and this was during a time when we actually used to drink tap water.    </seg>
<seg id="24"> I used to love going to this store,  but on one occasion I asked myself,  well how come you never buy anything?    </seg>
<seg id="25"> Here's their olive oil aisle.    </seg>
<seg id="26"> They had over 75 different kinds of olive oil,  including those that were in a locked case  that came from thousand-year-old olive trees.    </seg>
<seg id="27"> So I one day decided to pay a visit to the manager,  and I asked the manager,  "Is this model of offering people all this choice really working?"    </seg>
<seg id="28"> And he pointed to the busloads of tourists  that would show up everyday,  with cameras ready usually.    </seg>
<seg id="29"> We decided to do a little experiment,  and we picked jam for our experiment.    </seg>
<seg id="30"> Here's their jam aisle.    </seg>
<seg id="31"> They had 348 different kinds of jam.    </seg>
<seg id="32"> We set up a little tasting booth  right near the entrance of the store.    </seg>
<seg id="33"> We there put out six different flavors of jam  or 24 different flavors of jam,  and we looked at two things:  First, in which case  were people more likely to stop, sample some jam?    </seg>
<seg id="34"> More people stopped when there were 24, about 60 percent,  than when there were six,  about 40 percent.    </seg>
<seg id="35"> The next thing we looked at  is in which case were people more likely  to buy a jar of jam.    </seg>
<seg id="36"> Now we see the opposite effect.    </seg>
<seg id="37"> Of the people who stopped when there were 24,  only three percent of them actually bought a jar of jam.    </seg>
<seg id="38"> Of the people who stopped when there were six,  well now we saw that 30 percent of them  actually bought a jar of jam.    </seg>
<seg id="39"> Now if you do the math,  people were at least six times more likely to buy a jar of jam  if they encountered six  than if they encountered 24.    </seg>
<seg id="40"> Now choosing not to buy a jar of jam  is probably good for us --  at least it's good for our waistlines --  but it turns out that this choice overload problem affects us  even in very consequential decisions.    </seg>
<seg id="41"> We choose not to choose,  even when it goes against our best self-interests.    </seg>
<seg id="42"> So now for the topic of today: financial savings.    </seg>
<seg id="43"> Now I'm going to describe to you a study I did  with Gur Huberman, Emir Kamenica, Wei Jang  where we looked at the retirement savings decisions  of nearly a million Americans  from about 650 plans  all in the U.S.    </seg>
<seg id="44"> And what we looked at  was whether the number of fund offerings  available in a retirement savings plan,  the 401 plan,  does that affect people's likelihood  to save more for tomorrow.    </seg>
<seg id="45"> And what we found  was that indeed there was a correlation.    </seg>
<seg id="46"> So in these plans, we had about 657 plans  that ranged from offering people  anywhere from two to 59 different fund offerings.    </seg>
<seg id="47"> And what we found was that,  the more funds offered,  indeed, there was less participation rate.    </seg>
<seg id="48"> So if you look at the extremes,  those plans that offered you two funds,  participation rates were around in the mid-70s --  still not as high as we want it to be.    </seg>
<seg id="49"> In those plans that offered nearly 60 funds,  participation rates have now dropped  to about the 60th percentile.    </seg>
<seg id="50"> Now it turns out  that even if you do choose to participate  when there are more choices present,  even then, it has negative consequences.    </seg>
<seg id="51"> So for those people who did choose to participate,  the more choices available,  the more likely people were  to completely avoid stocks or equity funds.    </seg>
<seg id="52"> The more choices available,  the more likely they were  to put all their money in pure money market accounts.    </seg>
<seg id="53"> Now neither of these extreme decisions  are the kinds of decisions  that any of us would recommend for people  when you're considering their future financial well-being.    </seg>
<seg id="54"> Well, over the past decade,  we have observed three main negative consequences  to offering people more and more choices.    </seg>
<seg id="55"> They're more likely to delay choosing --  procrastinate even when it goes against their best self-interest.    </seg>
<seg id="56"> They're more likely to make worse choices --  worse financial choices, medical choices.    </seg>
<seg id="57"> They're more likely to choose things that make them less satisfied,  even when they do objectively better.    </seg>
<seg id="58"> The main reason for this  is because, we might enjoy gazing at those giant walls  of mayonnaises, mustards, vinegars, jams,  but we can't actually do the math of comparing and contrasting  and actually picking from that stunning display.    </seg>
<seg id="59"> So what I want to propose to you today  are four simple techniques --  techniques that we have tested in one way or another  in different research venues --  that you can easily apply  in your businesses.    </seg>
<seg id="60"> The first: Cut.    </seg>
<seg id="61"> You've heard it said before,  but it's never been more true than today,  that less is more.    </seg>
<seg id="62"> People are always upset when I say, "Cut."    </seg>
<seg id="63"> They're always worried they're going to lose shelf space.    </seg>
<seg id="64"> But in fact, what we're seeing more and more  is that if you are willing to cut,  get rid of those extraneous redundant options,  well there's an increase in sales,  there's a lowering of costs,  there is an improvement of the choosing experience.    </seg>
<seg id="65"> When Proctor &amp; Gamble  went from 26 different kinds of Head &amp; Shoulders to 15,  they saw an increase in sales by 10 percent.    </seg>
<seg id="66"> When the Golden Cat Corporation  got rid of their 10 worst-selling cat litter products,  they saw an increase in profits  by 87 percent --  a function of both increase in sales  and lowering of costs.    </seg>
<seg id="67"> You know, the average grocery store today  offers you 45,000 products.    </seg>
<seg id="68"> The typical Walmart today offers you 100,000 products.    </seg>
<seg id="69"> But the ninth largest retailer,  the ninth biggest retailer in the world today  is Aldi,  and it offers you only 1,400 products --  one kind of canned tomato sauce.    </seg>
<seg id="70"> Now in the financial savings world,  I think one of the best examples that has recently come out  on how to best manage the choice offerings  has actually been something that David Laibson was heavily involved in designing,  which was the program that they have at Harvard.    </seg>
<seg id="71"> Every single Harvard employee  is now automatically enrolled  in a lifecycle fund.    </seg>
<seg id="72"> For those people who actually want to choose,  they're given 20 funds,  not 300 or more funds.    </seg>
<seg id="73"> You know, often, people say,  "I don't know how to cut.    </seg>
<seg id="74"> They're all important choices."    </seg>
<seg id="75"> And the first thing I do is I ask the employees,  "Tell me how these choices are different from one another.    </seg>
<seg id="76"> And if your employees can't tell them apart,  neither can your consumers."    </seg>
<seg id="77"> Now before we started our session this afternoon,  I had a chat with Gary.    </seg>
<seg id="78"> And Gary said that he would be willing  to offer people in this audience  an all-expenses-paid free vacation  to the most beautiful road in the world.    </seg>
<seg id="79"> Here's a description of the road.    </seg>
<seg id="80"> And I'd like you to read it.    </seg>
<seg id="81"> And now I'll give you a few seconds to read it  and then I want you to clap your hands  if you're ready to take Gary up on his offer.    </seg>
<seg id="82"> (Light clapping)  Okay. Anybody who's ready to take him up on his offer.    </seg>
<seg id="83"> Is that all?    </seg>
<seg id="84"> All right, let me show you some more about this.    </seg>
<seg id="85">   You guys knew there was a trick, didn't you.    </seg>
<seg id="86">   Now who's ready to go on this trip.    </seg>
<seg id="87">     I think I might have actually heard more hands.    </seg>
<seg id="88"> All right.    </seg>
<seg id="89"> Now in fact,  you had objectively more information  the first time around than the second time around,  but I would venture to guess  that you felt that it was more real the second time around.    </seg>
<seg id="90"> Because the pictures made it feel  more real to you.    </seg>
<seg id="91"> Which brings me to the second technique  for handling the choice overload problem,  which is concretization.    </seg>
<seg id="92"> That in order for people to understand  the differences between the choices,  they have to be able to understand  the consequences associated with each choice,  and that the consequences need to be felt  in a vivid sort of way, in a very concrete way.    </seg>
<seg id="93"> Why do people spend an average of 15 to 30 percent more  when they use an ATM card or a credit card  as opposed to cash?    </seg>
<seg id="94"> Because it doesn't feel like real money.    </seg>
<seg id="95"> And it turns out  that making it feel more concrete  can actually be a very positive tool  to use in getting people to save more.    </seg>
<seg id="96"> So a study that I did with Shlomo Benartzi  and Alessandro Previtero,  we did a study with people at ING --  employees that are all working at ING --  and now these people were all in a session  where they're doing enrollment for their 401 plan.    </seg>
<seg id="97"> And during that session,  we kept the session exactly the way it used to be,  but we added one little thing.    </seg>
<seg id="98"> The one little thing we added  was we asked people  to just think about all the positive things that would happen in your life  if you saved more.    </seg>
<seg id="99"> By doing that simple thing,  there was an increase in enrollment by 20 percent  and there was an increase in the amount of people willing to save  or the amount that they were willing to put down into their savings account  by four percent.    </seg>
<seg id="100"> The third technique: Categorization.    </seg>
<seg id="101"> We can handle more categories  than we can handle choices.    </seg>
<seg id="102"> So for example,  here's a study we did in a magazine aisle.    </seg>
<seg id="103"> It turns out that in Wegmans grocery stores  up and down the northeast corridor,  the magazine aisles range anywhere  from 331 different kinds of magazines  all the way up to 664.    </seg>
<seg id="104"> But you know what?    </seg>
<seg id="105"> If I show you 600 magazines  and I divide them up into 10 categories,  versus I show you 400 magazines  and divide them up into 20 categories,  you believe that I have given you  more choice and a better choosing experience  if I gave you the 400  than if I gave you the 600.    </seg>
<seg id="106"> Because the categories tell me how to tell them apart.    </seg>
<seg id="107"> Here are two different jewelry displays.    </seg>
<seg id="108"> One is called "Jazz" and the other one is called "Swing."    </seg>
<seg id="109"> If you think the display on the left is Swing  and the display on the right is Jazz,  clap your hands.    </seg>
<seg id="110"> (Light Clapping)  Okay, there's some.    </seg>
<seg id="111"> If you think the one on the left is Jazz and the one on the right is Swing,  clap your hands.    </seg>
<seg id="112"> Okay, a bit more.    </seg>
<seg id="113"> Now it turns out you're right.    </seg>
<seg id="114"> The one on the left is Jazz and the one on the right is Swing,  but you know what?    </seg>
<seg id="115"> This is a highly useless categorization scheme.    </seg>
<seg id="116">   The categories need to say something  to the chooser, not the choice-maker.    </seg>
<seg id="117"> And you often see that problem  when it comes down to those long lists of all these funds.    </seg>
<seg id="118"> Who are they actually supposed to be informing?    </seg>
<seg id="119"> My fourth technique: Condition for complexity.    </seg>
<seg id="120"> It turns out we can actually  handle a lot more information than we think we can,  we've just got to take it a little easier.    </seg>
<seg id="121"> We have to gradually increase the complexity.    </seg>
<seg id="122"> I'm going to show you one example of what I'm talking about.    </seg>
<seg id="123"> Let's take a very, very complicated decision:  buying a car.    </seg>
<seg id="124"> Here's a German car manufacturer  that gives you the opportunity to completely custom make your car.    </seg>
<seg id="125"> You've got to make 60 different decisions,  completely make up your car.    </seg>
<seg id="126"> Now these decisions vary  in the number of choices that they offer per decision.    </seg>
<seg id="127"> Car colors, exterior car colors --  I've got 56 choices.    </seg>
<seg id="128"> Engines, gearshift -- four choices.    </seg>
<seg id="129"> So now what I'm going to do  is I'm going to vary the order in which these decisions appear.    </seg>
<seg id="130"> So half of the customers  are going to go from high choice, 56 car colors,  to low choice, four gearshifts.    </seg>
<seg id="131"> The other half of the customers  are going to go from low choice, four gearshifts,  to 56 car colors, high choice.    </seg>
<seg id="132"> What am I going to look at?    </seg>
<seg id="133"> How engaged you are.    </seg>
<seg id="134"> If you keep hitting the default button per decision,  that means you're getting overwhelmed,  that means I'm losing you.    </seg>
<seg id="135"> What you find  is the people who go from high choice to low choice,  they're hitting that default button over and over and over again.    </seg>
<seg id="136"> We're losing them.    </seg>
<seg id="137"> They go from low choice to high choice,  they're hanging in there.    </seg>
<seg id="138"> It's the same information. It's the same number of choices.    </seg>
<seg id="139"> The only thing that I have done  is I have varied the order  in which that information is presented.    </seg>
<seg id="140"> If I start you off easy,  I learn how to choose.    </seg>
<seg id="141"> Even though choosing gearshift  doesn't tell me anything about my preferences for interior decor,  it still prepares me for how to choose.    </seg>
<seg id="142"> It also gets me excited about this big product that I'm putting together,  so I'm more willing to be motivated  to be engaged.    </seg>
<seg id="143"> So let me recap.    </seg>
<seg id="144"> I have talked about four techniques  for mitigating the problem of choice overload --  cut -- get rid of the extraneous alternatives;  concretize -- make it real;  categorize -- we can handle more categories, less choices;  condition for complexity.    </seg>
<seg id="145"> All of these techniques that I'm describing to you today  are designed to help you manage your choices --  better for you, you can use them on yourself,  better for the people that you are serving.    </seg>
<seg id="146"> Because I believe that the key  to getting the most from choice  is to be choosy about choosing.    </seg>
<seg id="147"> And the more we're able to be choosy about choosing  the better we will be able  to practice the art of choosing.    </seg>
<seg id="148"> Thank you very much.    </seg>

<title>Mikko Hypponen: Three types of online attack</title> 
<reviewer></reviewer> 
<translator></translator> 
<seg id="1"> In the 1980s  in the communist Eastern Germany,  if you owned a typewriter,  you had to register it with the government.    </seg>
<seg id="2"> You had to register  a sample sheet of text  out of the typewriter.    </seg>
<seg id="3"> And this was done  so the government could track where text was coming from.    </seg>
<seg id="4"> If they found a paper  which had the wrong kind of thought,  they could track down  who created that thought.    </seg>
<seg id="5"> And we in the West  couldn't understand how anybody could do this,  how much this would restrict freedom of speech.    </seg>
<seg id="6"> We would never do that  in our own countries.    </seg>
<seg id="7"> But today in 2011,  if you go and buy a color laser printer  from any major laser printer manufacturer  and print a page,  that page will end up  having slight yellow dots  printed on every single page  in a pattern which makes the page unique  to you and to your printer.    </seg>
<seg id="8"> This is happening  to us today.    </seg>
<seg id="9"> And nobody seems to be making a fuss about it.    </seg>
<seg id="10"> And this is an example  of the ways  that our own governments  are using technology  against us, the citizens.    </seg>
<seg id="11"> And this is one of the main three sources  of online problems today.    </seg>
<seg id="12"> If we take a look at what's really happening in the online world,  we can group the attacks based on the attackers.    </seg>
<seg id="13"> We have three main groups.    </seg>
<seg id="14"> We have online criminals.    </seg>
<seg id="15"> Like here, we have Mr. Dimitry Golubov  from the city of Kiev in Ukraine.    </seg>
<seg id="16"> And the motives of online criminals  are very easy to understand.    </seg>
<seg id="17"> These guys make money.    </seg>
<seg id="18"> They use online attacks  to make lots of money,  and lots and lots of it.    </seg>
<seg id="19"> We actually have several cases  of millionaires online, multimillionaires,  who made money with their attacks.    </seg>
<seg id="20"> Here's Vladimir Tsastsin form Tartu in Estonia.    </seg>
<seg id="21"> This is Alfred Gonzalez.    </seg>
<seg id="22"> This is Stephen Watt.    </seg>
<seg id="23"> This is Bjorn Sundin.    </seg>
<seg id="24"> This is Matthew Anderson, Tariq Al-Daour  and so on and so on.    </seg>
<seg id="25"> These guys  make their fortunes online,  but they make it through the illegal means  of using things like banking trojans  to steal money from our bank accounts  while we do online banking,  or with keyloggers  to collect our credit card information  while we are doing online shopping from an infected computer.    </seg>
<seg id="26"> The U.S. Secret Service,  two months ago,  froze the Swiss bank account  of Mr. Sam Jain right here,  and that bank account had 14.9 million U.S. dollars on it  when it was frozen.    </seg>
<seg id="27"> Mr. Jain himself is on the loose;  nobody knows where he is.    </seg>
<seg id="28"> And I claim it's already today  that it's more likely for any of us  to become the victim of a crime online  than here in the real world.    </seg>
<seg id="29"> And it's very obvious  that this is only going to get worse.    </seg>
<seg id="30"> In the future, the majority of crime  will be happening online.    </seg>
<seg id="31"> The second major group of attackers  that we are watching today  are not motivated by money.    </seg>
<seg id="32"> They're motivated by something else --  motivated by protests,  motivated by an opinion,  motivated by the laughs.    </seg>
<seg id="33"> Groups like Anonymous  have risen up over the last 12 months  and have become a major player  in the field of online attacks.    </seg>
<seg id="34"> So those are the three main attackers:  criminals who do it for the money,  hacktivists like Anonymous  doing it for the protest,  but then the last group are nation states,  governments doing the attacks.    </seg>
<seg id="35"> And then we look at cases  like what happened in DigiNotar.    </seg>
<seg id="36"> This is a prime example of what happens  when governments attack  against their own citizens.    </seg>
<seg id="37"> DigiNotar is a Certificate Authority  from The Netherlands --  or actually, it was.    </seg>
<seg id="38"> It was running into bankruptcy  last fall  because they were hacked into.    </seg>
<seg id="39"> Somebody broke in  and they hacked it thoroughly.    </seg>
<seg id="40"> And I asked last week  in a meeting with Dutch government representatives,  I asked one of the leaders of the team  whether he found plausible  that people died  because of the DigiNotar hack.    </seg>
<seg id="41"> And his answer was yes.    </seg>
<seg id="42"> So how do people die  as the result of a hack like this?    </seg>
<seg id="43"> Well DigiNotar is a C.A.    </seg>
<seg id="44"> They sell certificates.    </seg>
<seg id="45"> What do you do with certificates?    </seg>
<seg id="46"> Well you need a certificate  if you have a website that has https,  SSL encrypted services,  services like Gmail.    </seg>
<seg id="47"> Now we all, or a big part of us,  use Gmail or one of their competitors,  but these services are especially popular  in totalitarian states  like Iran,  where dissidents  use foreign services like Gmail  because they know they are more trustworthy than the local services  and they are encrypted over SSL connections,  so the local government can't snoop  on their discussions.    </seg>
<seg id="48"> Except they can if they hack into a foreign C.A.    </seg>
<seg id="49"> and issue rogue certificates.    </seg>
<seg id="50"> And this is exactly what happened  with the case of DigiNotar.    </seg>
<seg id="51"> What about Arab Spring  and things that have been happening, for example, in Egypt?    </seg>
<seg id="52"> Well in Egypt,  the rioters looted the headquarters  of the Egyptian secret police  in April 2011,  and when they were looting the building they found lots of papers.    </seg>
<seg id="53"> Among those papers,  was this binder entitled "FINFISHER."    </seg>
<seg id="54"> And within that binder were notes  from a company based in Germany  which had sold the Egyptian government  a set of tools  for intercepting --  and in very large scale --  all the communication of the citizens of the country.    </seg>
<seg id="55"> They had sold this tool  for 280,000 Euros to the Egyptian government.    </seg>
<seg id="56"> The company headquarters are right here.    </seg>
<seg id="57"> So Western governments  are providing totalitarian governments with tools  to do this against their own citizens.    </seg>
<seg id="58"> But Western governments are doing it to themselves as well.    </seg>
<seg id="59"> For example, in Germany,  just a couple of weeks ago  the so-called State Trojan was found,  which was a trojan  used by German government officials  to investigate their own citizens.    </seg>
<seg id="60"> If you are a suspect in a criminal case,  well it's pretty obvious, your phone will be tapped.    </seg>
<seg id="61"> But today, it goes beyond that.    </seg>
<seg id="62"> They will tap your Internet connection.    </seg>
<seg id="63"> They will even use tools like State Trojan  to infect your computer with a trojan,  which enables them  to watch all your communication,  to listen to your online discussions,  to collect your passwords.    </seg>
<seg id="64"> Now when we think deeper  about things like these,  the obvious response from people should be  that, "Okay, that sounds bad,  but that doesn't really affect me because I'm a legal citizen.    </seg>
<seg id="65"> Why should I worry?    </seg>
<seg id="66"> Because I have nothing to hide."    </seg>
<seg id="67"> And this is an argument,  which doesn't make sense.    </seg>
<seg id="68"> Privacy is implied.    </seg>
<seg id="69"> Privacy is not up for discussion.    </seg>
<seg id="70"> This is not a question  between privacy  against security.    </seg>
<seg id="71"> It's a question of freedom  against control.    </seg>
<seg id="72"> And while we might trust our governments  right now, right here in 2011,  any right we give away will be given away for good.    </seg>
<seg id="73"> And do we trust, do we blindly trust,  any future government,  a government we might have  50 years from now?    </seg>
<seg id="74"> And these are the questions  that we have to worry about for the next 50 years.    </seg>
